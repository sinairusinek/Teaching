# Github Tutorial
## Introduction
The Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. It is a simple exercise that gets you started when learning something new. Let’s get started with GitHub!
You’ll learn how to:
Create and use a repository
Start and manage a new branch
Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits
Open and merge a pull request
What is GitHub?
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and Pull Requests. You’ll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub’s Pull Request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.
No coding necessary
To complete this tutorial, you need a GitHub.com account and Internet access. You don’t need to know how to code, use the command line, or install Git (the version control software GitHub is built on).
Tip: Open this guide in a separate browser window (or tab) so you can see it while you complete the steps in the tutorial.

## Step 1. Download tools

- GitHub Desktop https://desktop.github.com/
- Atom Editor  https://atom.io/

## Step 2. Create a GitHub user account
Go to Github.com and Sign up (do try and remember your username and password!)

## Step 2. Create a Repository
A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. It also offers other common options such as a license file.
Your hello-world repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.
To create a new repository
In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click the +sign  and then select New repository.

Name your repository myRepo.
Write a short description.
Select Initialize this repository with a README.
