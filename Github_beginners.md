# Github Tutorial
## Introduction
The Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. It is a simple exercise that gets you started when learning something new. Let’s get started with GitHub!
You’ll learn how to:
- Create and use a repository
- Start and manage a new branch
- Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits
- Open and merge a pull request

###What is GitHub?
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

Tip: Open this guide in a separate browser window (or tab) so you can see it while you complete the steps in the tutorial.

## Step 1. Download and install tools

- GitHub Desktop https://desktop.github.com/
- Atom Editor  https://atom.io/

## Step 2. Create a GitHub user account
Go to Github.com and Sign up (do try and remember your username and password!)

Connect your github desktop to your user account by choosing “preferences” under GitHub Desktop and signing in.

## Step 2. Clone this repository
Cloning is creating your own version of a repository in your own space.
Go back to https://github.com/sinairusinek/Teaching and click "clone", then go to your github account and find your a version of the "teaching" repository in your repositories.


## Step 3. Create your own Repository
A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. It also offers other common options such as a license file.
Your repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.
To create a new repository
In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click the +sign  and then select New repository.
