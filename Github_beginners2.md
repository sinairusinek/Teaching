# Github Tutorial
## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

Tip: Open this guide in a separate browser window (or tab) so you can see it while you complete the steps in the tutorial.

## Step 1. Download and install tools

- GitHub Desktop https://desktop.github.com/
- Atom Editor  https://atom.io/

## Step 2. Create a GitHub user account
Go to Github.com and Sign up (do try and remember your username and password!)

Connect your github desktop to your user account by choosing “preferences” under GitHub Desktop and signing in.

## Step 3. Clone this repository
Cloning is creating your own version of a repository in your own space.
Go back to https://github.com/sinairusinek/Teaching and click "clone", then go to your github account and find your version of the "teaching" repository in your repositories.


## Step 4. Create your own Repository
A repository is usually used to organize a single project. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project. To create a new repository, in the upper right corner, next to your avatar, click the +sign  and then select New repository.
