THE Preface Introductory ADDRESS'D To the very Ingenious and Learned Doctor J. L.
I Willingly acknowledge, that divers Physicians have Am∣ply and Learnedly, and some of them very Eloquently, set forth the praises of the Blood, and manifested how noble and excellent a Liquor it is, But I must beg their pardon if I doubt whether their Writings have not better celebrated its Praises, then discover'd to us its Nature. For, tho the laudable curiosity Page  [unnumbered] of the Moderns has acquainted us with several things not deli∣ver'd to us by the Ancients, yet, if I mistake not, what is gene∣rally known of Humane Blood, is as yet imperfect enough, and consists much more of Observa∣tions than Experiments; being suggested far more by the Phae∣nomena that Nature her self has afforded Physicians, than by Tryals industriously made, to find what she will not, unsoli∣cited by Art, discover. I will not be so rash as to say, that to mind (as too many Anatomists have done) the Solid parts of the Body, and overlook Enqui∣ries into the Fluids, and especi∣ally the Blood, were little less Page  [unnumbered] improper in a Physician, than it would be in a Vintner to be very solicitous about the Stru∣cture of his Cask, and neglect the consideration of the Wine contain'd in it. But though I will not make so bold a Com∣parison, yet when I consider how important a part of the Humane Body, the Blood is; and that as when it is well con∣stituted, and does orderly move, it conveys nourishment and vi∣gour, and motion, and in a word health to the rest of the living Engine: So the Mass of Blood being either vitiated, or (which is very often the effect of that Depravation) disorderly mov'd, is the Seat of divers, and Page  [unnumbered] the Cause of most Diseases, whose cure consequently depends main∣ly upon the rectifying of the Blood when (I say,) I consider these things, I cannot but think it an Omission, that so important a Subject has not been more skil∣fully and industriously enquir'd into. But I hope you were not in earnest, when you solicited me to repair that Omission. For you know, I have not the Va∣nity to pretend to be a Physician. And being none, I must want both the Skill and many Op∣portunities, wherewith a Man that were professedly so, would be advantag'd. And though I deny not that many years ago I propounded to some Ingenious Page  [unnumbered] Physicians a History of the Fluid parts of the Body, such as the Humours and other Juices, and also the Spirits of it; and did particularly draw up a set of En∣quiries, and make divers Expe∣riments in reference to the Blood, yet those Papers being since lost, and a long Tract of Time, and Studies of a quite other na∣ture, having made me lose the Memory of most of the Parti∣culars; I find my self unable to contribute any thing conside∣rable to your laudable design. And as all the search your Com∣mands oblig'd me to make after my Papers, has hitherto prov'd fruitless, so they having been written when I had far more Page  [unnumbered] Health, Vigour, and Leisure than I now have, and when my Thoughts were much more conversant with Medicinal Sub∣jects; any thing that I shall now present you about the Blood, will not only be extremely short of what ought to be said, but will also be short even of what, if I mistake not, I did say of it. But yet all this is said, not to excuse me from obeying you at all, but to excuse me for obey∣ing you so unskilfully. For, since you will have me set down what I can retrieve about Hu∣mane Blood, you shall receive it in the following Paper; which consists of Four Parts. The First whereof contains a set of TitlesPage  [unnumbered] (which I call Of the First Order, for Reasons to be given you in the Advertisements about them) towards the Natural and Medi∣cal History of Humane Blood, which may direct those that want better Guides, what Enquiries to make, and to what Heads to refer, what they have found by Observation or Tryal. But be∣cause this Part contains but bare Titles (whose Systeme yet per∣haps I look upon as likely to make the usefullest part of the ensuing Papers) and because I have neither leisure nor Materi∣als to answer all or most of the Titles, I thought fit in a couple of Subjects, namely the Serum of Humane Blood, which is a Page  [unnumbered]Natural, and the Spirit, which is a Factitious part of it, to give some instances of what I had thoughts to do on others; and propose some Example to those that may be more un∣practis'd in drawing up Natural Histories, than the general de∣sign and course of my Studies of Natural Things permitted me to be. And what is said on these two Subjects, makes the Third and Fourth Part of these Papers. As for the other Titles (of the History of the Blood) I contented my self, in compli∣ance with my haste, to set down what occur'd to me in the Ca∣sual Order wherein they offer'd themselves; without scrupling Page  [unnumbered] to mingle here and there among the Historical Notes, some Ex∣periments that I formerly but design'd, as Tryals that might prove Luciferous, whatever the event should be. This Rapso∣dy of my own Observations makes one of the Four Parts, and the Second in Order, of what your Commands embolden me to offer you at this time. And I shall be very glad to be so happy as to find, that by doing a thing, that I am wont to do so delightfully as to obey you, I have by breaking the Ice contri∣buted something to so noble and useful a work as the History of Humane Blood. About which, that I may not make the Porch much Page  [unnumbered] too great for the Building, I shall add to this Preamble no∣thing but these two Advertise∣ments; of which the First shall be, That it is not my design in these Papers, to treat of my Subject, as it may be consider'd (to borrow a School Phrase) in fieri, which would have oblig'd me to trace the Progress from the reception of Aliments at the Mouth, to the full Elabora∣tion, which were to write the History of Sanguification as well as that of Blood; but to treat of this Liquor as 'tis compleatly elaborated, and that too, not as 'tis form'd in the Vessels of a living Body, but as it is Extra∣vasated, and let out by the Lan∣cet; Page  [unnumbered] such Blood alone being that on which I had some opportu∣nity to make Tryals, and to this first Advertisement, I shall subjoyn as the Second, That in the following Papers I have, as the Title intimates, treated but of such Humane Blood, as was taken from sound Persons; both because being no profess'd Physi∣cian, I had not the Opportunities of Examining that of Sick Per∣sons molested with particular Diseases, (which yet would much conduce to a compleat History of the Blood;) and be∣cause the Knowledge of the Nature of the Blood, when 'tis rightly conditioned, is necessary to those that would discern, in Page  [unnumbered] what particulars, and how far it deviates in the Sick, according to that generally received Axiome, Rectum est Index sui & Obliqui: On which account the Scheme of Titles drawn up for the Hi∣story of Healthy Blood, may serve for a direction to any that would write the History of Morbid or Depraved Blood in any particular Disease, as a Pleurisie, a Quar∣tan Ague, the Dropsy, the Scur∣vy, &c. For having compared the Qualities and Accidents of this vitiated Blood, with those of the Blood of Sound Men deliver'd in the foremen∣tioned Systeme of Titles, 'twill not be difficult for a Physician to find, to what heads he is to Page  [unnumbered] refer those things that conside∣rably recede from such as be∣long to Healthy Blood. And these Recessions or Depravations, with perhaps a few Additions of some Peculiarities, if any oc∣cur, will make up the History of the Blood as 'tis wont to be vi∣tiated in that Particular Disease, one General Admonition suf∣ficing (if that it self be not un∣necessary) to make the Reader take notice, that in all other Points the Blood of Persons sick of that Disease is not unlike that of those that are Healthy.

THE Natural History OF Humane Blood. PART. I. Containing A List of Titles for the History of Humane Blood. To which are Premis'd some Advertisements about them.
THat the Scope and meaning of the ensuing Scheme of Titles, (and divers others that I drew up for differ∣ing Subjects) may be the more clear∣ly understood, I must lay down in this place some passages borrowed from Page  2 the (unpublish'd) Essay or Letter I wrote to Mr. Oldenburg (Secretary to the R. Society) about the way of compile∣ing a Natural History. I propos'd then in that tract three sorts of Heads, to which the particulars that might oc∣curr, and properly belong to the History of the Subject to be treated of, whether a Body, or a Quality or an Operation, or a Process, (that is, a pro∣gressive change) might conveniently be referred. These distinct sets of To∣picks or Enquiries I call Orders, Ranks or classes, and because to each of these sets, it was found by Experience, that things of somewhat differing nature were to be referr'd, as Queries more properly So called, Propositions either Affirmative or Negative, and other Heads of Natural History, that are less fit to be reduc'd to either of the two former Sorts, then to be look'd upon as Subjects to be treated of. For this reason, I say, among others, I thought fit to comprize all these sorts of particular Topicks, or Articles or Page  3 Inquiry (to use our illustrious Ʋerulam's phrase) under the ge∣neral and comprehensive name of Titles.
The first Order or Classis of these Titles, I would have to consist of such as occurr'd readily enough to my thoughts, upon the first deliberate view, or general Survey, of the Sub∣ject to be treated of. For 'tis scarce to be expected that at the first attempt a man should be so clear sighted, or so happy, as to pitch, or light upon as di∣rect and compendious ways of Inda∣gation, and as good Methods of Di∣gesting, and delivering what is disco∣vered, as when a studious Enquiry has furnish'd him with better Infor∣mations about the Subject he is to treat of; and therefore it may suffice for the first time, that the mind do as it were walk round the Object, it is to contemplate, and view it on every side, observing what differing Pro∣spects it will that way afford, (as when a Painter or an Anatomist Page  4 looks upon a mans Body, first when the Face and Belly are towards him, then when the Back and other hin∣der parts are so) and that he takes no∣tice of the Limits and Boundaries of it, and of the most Essential and con∣siderable Parts, or other things that belong to it. Wherefore in the first Uassis of Titles, one need not be too scrupulous about the enumerating, and marshalling the Particulars referable to it, but may be more Solicitous, that the Titles should be various, and comprehensive enough, than that they should be nicely Methodical, and much less than that they should be accommodated to any particular Hy∣pothesis. And because, even at the first deliberate view, some (though perhaps very few) of these Titles may appear considerable, and fertile enough to deserve, that there should to each of them be refer'd two or a greater number of Subordinate, and more particular Topicks; I thought fit for methods sake to call the Capi∣tal Page  5 Titles, that is those of the first Classis, Primary Titles, and the Subordinate, Secondary ones. [Of which Distinction a Notable Instance will be met with in what is hereafter delivered, about the Spirit of Hu∣mane Blood. All the Sixteen Titles together with the Appendix, contain∣ed in that Epistolary Discourse, be∣ing Secondary Titles, referable to that Primary one, which is the Eighteenth in the first Classis of the History of Hu∣mane Blood.]
When by Reading, Conference, Me∣ditation, and (which is here mainly to be consider'd) the Tryals suggested in the Topics of the first Classis, or or∣der, the Naturalist has receiv'd the best and fullest Information he can procure, of all that belongs to the Subject he is to treat of, he may then proceed to frame another set of Titles, which may be called the Second,or (if no other interpose) the last Order or Classis of them, which, if he have been diligent and any Page  6 thing prosperous, will be much more copious and better rang'd than the first.
For now divers things will in likely∣hood appear to belong to the Subject of the History, which were not at first taken notice of to do so, yea per∣haps were not at all thought of, and the further discovery made of the na∣ture of the thing treated of, may direct the Historian to range his To∣pics, or Titles in a better Order, and more natural Method, than those of the first Classis. And, which is a thing of far greater Moment, divers, and perhaps most, of the Particular Titles will appear to be of greater extent, or more comprehensive, than they were formerly conceived to be: so that a Particular Title may well be thought fit to be branch'd into many Subordinate Topics, or Articles (which we lately called Secondary Titles) some one of which may perhaps com∣prize as many Experiments, or Ob∣servations, as 'twas at first guess'd Page  7 would appertain to the prime or more general Title itself. And from the Materials orderly drawn together under this last set or Classis of Titles, with some requisite changes in point of Method, and Connexions, and some Additional things as Transitions &c. by the help I say, of such Alterations and Additions, the Particulars where∣of the last Order or Classisconsists, may be digested and framed into an Inchoate Natural History of the Sub∣ject they have relation to; I said, an Inchoate History, to intimate, hat even after all that has been already done, I think it too probable that the History will hereafter appear to have been ra∣ther begun then compleated, the na∣ture of things, & the Industry of skil∣ful men being so very fertile, that the knowledg of the Subject of the Histo∣ry will from time to time be en∣creas'd, and so the History it self may be enlarged and corrected, but will not, I fear in many Ages, if ever it be at all, be made absolutely perfect.
Page  8And on this occasion I must add That when the Subject to be treated of is very comprehensive or very Difficult, as the Generation of living Creatures, Magnetism, Fermentation, Gravity, &c. it may be very useful, if not almost necessary, to interpose between the Titles of the Last and those of the First Classis, a set of Titles that may be call'd of the middleOrder, or Classis. For the framing whereof the Historian is considerately and narrowly to re∣survey the Nature of the Subject, and make a heedful Collation of that, and of the several Notices attain'd by his Endeavours to furnish the differing Titles of the first Classis with a Com∣petent number of Particulars. For by this Collation there will in likelihood be suggested to him, many new To∣pics of Enquiry, and Hints, which added to the former will deserve to have a new Classis fram'd consisting of Articles more copious, and various than the First, and fit to be rang'd Page  9 in another Order. It may perhaps illustrate what I have been saying and am going to say, about the several Classes of Titles, if on this occasion I shall add, that a Natural Subject being proposed to be Histo∣rically treated of, there may occurr something like what happen'd to the Israelites, in reference to the Land of Canaan. For at their first entrance into it, Joshua, and the other Spyes took a transient view of the Country, and could bring back but an unaccurate account of it, together with a little of the most remarkable Fruit. But upon a second Expedition, the Spyes were furnished with fuller Instructions, and order'd to direct their Researches to the answering of a great many particular Articles of Enquiry; their Industry to answer which produced in Methodical Tables or Schemes, a far more copious and distinct Chorography, and Sur∣vey of the fruitfull land of Canaan.
It is scarce to be expected that Page  10 at the very first time the Titles, whether Primary or Secondary, of a natural History should be made so comprehensive, and be so skilful∣ly bounded, as not to need to be either enlarged, or reformed by Se∣cond Thoughts, and a further Pro∣gress in the Practical knowledge of the Subject treated of. I therefore thought it necessary, or at least useful, to subjoin to the first Edi∣tion of the Titles of each of the Natural Histories, I delineated, a Mantissa or Appendix, that should consist of two Sorts of Particulars; viz, Paralipomena and other Ad∣denda, whereof the first should contain such things, as may be properly referrable to some one or more of the Titles, (either Pri∣mary, or Secondary,) distinctly enumerated in the Scheme of the History, and were but by haste or oversight kept from having place among them. The other consists of new Particulars, that, Page  11 after the History was written, were Suggested by further Disco∣veries; whether these Particu∣lars did directly belong to any of the preceding Titles, or might only in a general way contri∣bute somewhat to the know∣ledge, or illustration of the Subject.

An Appendix, containing
    • 1. PAralipomena relating to the History of Humane Blood.
    • 2. Miscellaneous Observations, Ex∣periments and Enquiries about Hu∣mane Blood (to be added to the History of it.)
Page  15I do not think it unlikely that some of the Titles of our intended History of Blood and a greater num∣ber of the particulars that you will meet with in it, may seem frivolous to you at the first perusal. But per∣haps in process of time, these very things will not appear impertinent, nor be found useless. For 'tis a mat∣ter, as of more difficulty, so of more utility, than men are wont at first to discern, to find out, and bring into a narrow compass, a considera∣ble number of particulars relating to one Subject, and present them as it were at one view, to the Intellect to act upon And there is many a particular Experiment o• Observation which upon the first, or perhaps the 2d reading may seem but slight or Su∣perfluous, which afterwards is found capable of being made good use of by those who seriously intend, and en∣deavour to attain, not a maim'd or a Superficial, but a deep and solid knowledge of the Subject of their Page  16 Enquiry. And to such Indagators many particulars, that at first were past by unregarded, because there appeared no direct use or obvious application of them, will be found serviceable to hint new Hypotheses or Theories, or to illustrate them, to examine those of others, and if they be true, to confirm them, and if er∣roneous, to confute them. For, to be short, the knowledge of matters of fact cannot but be some way or o∣ther, and probably more ways than one, serviceable to a Naturalist, that has Sagacity and Judgment to make a right use of them.
Having already advertis'd you, that the following Papers treat of none but Extravasated Blood, since I had no other at command, to make my Tryals upon; I presume you will not wonder that you find not in the Scheme of Titles such as these.
Of the Process of Sanguification, or the Series of changes that the Ali∣ment successively undergoes, from Page  17 its being taken in at the mouth, till it be turned into Blood.
Of the motions of the Mass of Blood, and particularly its Circula∣tion.
Of the Chyle, Lympha, and other Liquors, that are suppos'd to enter and mingle with the Blood.
Whether the Humours, Phlegm, Gall, and Melancholy, be really con∣tained in the Blood, as constituent Parts of it.
Whether some other substances may not with as much reason be admitted into the composition of the Blood.
These, as I was saying, and per∣haps some other Titles should have been added, if my Design had reach∣ed further, than to treat of Blood se∣parated from the Body, and I wish that you, who by your Abilities and Profession are far better qualify'd than I for such a work, would fill up these, Titles and add them, some as Pre∣liminaries, and others as Appendices,Page  18 to the History of Blood I have ad∣ventur'd to begin.
Perhaps it may not be altogether impertinent to add, that I had once some Thoughts of a Designation of a Natural History of other Liquors of a humane Body, as well as the Blood; I mean such as the Gall, the Lympha, the Succus Pancreaticus, Spittle, Urine, Milk, &c. But I quickly perceiv'd it was fit for me to resign such Tasks to Physicians; only I shall here Subjoin, as a small Specimen, a set of Titles for the History of Urine, which though by reason of its Affinity in many re∣gards to Blood, it must have many Titles in common with it, yet some will be differing according to the na∣ture of the Subject; which (Liquor) I therefore pitch upon, because I dare own to you, and I do it not without Premeditation, and having wrought on Urine longer than on a Blood itself, that I think Urine to be a Liquor, which, as much despis'd as it is by o∣thers, deserves to be solicitously en∣quir'd Page  19 into by Physicians, Naturalists, and upon special Accounts by Chy∣mists; who will perhaps be excited to seek and hope for great matters, both for Medicine and Alchymy, from this Liquor skilfully handled, when they consider that the Phos∣phorus, of which I have elsewhere related so many new, and some of them surprizing, Phaenomena, is made, at least according to my way of Meer Urine by a Simple Distilla∣tion.

The II. Part. Containing Miscellaneous Experiments and Observations, about Humane Blood.
IF I were furnished with all the for∣mer Experiments, Observations, and Papers, that at several times I made and wrote about Humane Blood, or were supplyed with Ma∣terials and Opportunities to repair the want of them, (as possibly, God assisting, I may hereafter be,) this Second Part of our Work would per∣haps appear much less maimed, and jejune, than it will now be found. But I am so sensible of the disadvantage, that the want of those requisite helps must have brought to this Rapsody of unconnected Notes, (written at differing times, and on differing occa∣sions) that I was more than once in∣clin'd Page  25 totally to omit it. And 'tis the im∣portance of the Subject, upon which even mean Experiments may some∣times prove of good use, that keeps me from suppressing it. Which I thus early give notice of, that nothing more than loose Experiments, and those refera∣ble but to some of the Titles of the History of Humane Blood, (divers others being left untouch'd) may in the Second Part of our Memoirs be expected.

HAving for some reasons, that need not here be men∣tion'd, been induc'd to enquire of more than one person, that has us'd to let many men Blood, whe∣ther they did not observe, that some persons found a manifest and considerable change in the heat of the Blood, as it came to issue out first or last? I was answered Affirmatively and told that several persons that had no Feaver said, that after their Blood had run out a while, they found it come sensibly hotter than before; and some of them complain'd, that it came with a degree of Heat that was troublesom, and as they fancy'd, ready to scald them.

I Got a Chirurgeon to put a seal'd Weather-glass, adjusted by the Standard of Gresham Colledge, into the Porringer wherein he was going to bleed a young Gentlewoman, that, as the Blood ran out of the open Vein, it might fall upon the Ball of the Instrument; in which the Liquor was made by the warmth to ascend a good way, but not much (if at all) nearer than about an Inch to the smaller upper Ball of the Ther∣moscope.

BUt within less than an hour be∣fore this time, having procu∣red a man of middle age (that seemed healthy enough, and was let blood in the same Shop by the same Chi∣rurgeon) to bleed upon the same Wea∣ther-glass, the tincted Spirit of Wine ascended above all the Marks be∣longing to the Stem, and from the top of the stem expanded it self to a considerable quantity in the small up∣per Ball of the Stem, (for the Chirur∣geon told me it was a fourth part of the height of the Ball;) so that, though we could not determine how high it would have risen if the Stem had been long enough, yet it seem'd ma∣nifest that the Warmth that made it rise, did considerably exceed the Page  29 usual Warmth of the Air in the Dog-days, these gag'd Thermoscopes be∣ing wont to be so fram'd, as to keep the Liquor in the Stem all the year long without sinking quite into the greater Ball in Winter, or ascending into the lesser in Summer.
We employed also, when a young Woman was blooded, a sealed Ther∣mometer that was not gag'd, but was much shorter than the other, and in this the tincted Spirit was raised almost to the top, which argued no inconsiderable degree of Heat.

I know not whether it may be worth while to take notice on this occasion, that a Porringer whereinto a healthy man had been let blood having been brought from the Chi∣rurgeons house to my Lodging, though the Blood was already Coa∣gulated, yet when I thrust into it the Ball of the forementioned gag'd Ther∣moscope, it appeared to have retained Warmth enough to make the Spirit of Urine ascend, by my guess, at least Three or Four fingers breadth above its former station.

SInce Humane Blood does in Distil∣lation afford a not inconsiderable quantity of Oyl, one may well suppose it to be a Combustible Body: but every one will not think it so Inflammable, as upon Tryal purposely made I found it to be. For having taken a piece of Humane Blood dryed till it was al∣most pulverable, and held it in the flame of a Candle, it would take fire, and afford a Flame much like that which excited it, burning with a crackling noise (much like that of Sea Salt cast into the Fire) and here and there melting. But the Inflammable∣ness of such dryed Blood did much better appear, when putting together 4 or 5 throughly kindled Coals, we laid on them a piece of dry'd Blood Page  32 of the bigness of a small Nutmeg, or thereabouts, for this yielded a copious and very yellow Flame, and if it were seasonably and warily blown from time to time, as the Effluviadege∣nerated into smoak, it would by these frequent re-accensions continue to yield clear and Yellow Flames of no contemptible bigness (in proportion to the Body that yielded them) much longer than one would expect. And during a good part of this Deflagra∣tion, the Blood appeared as it were to fry upon the Coals, and in good part to melt into a Black substance almost like Pitch. There was also a crackling noise produc'd, like that which Chymists observe when they decrepitate common Salt.
These Experiments for the sub∣stance were repeated. But I shewed another Instance of the Inflammable∣ness of Blood, that was somewhat surprising. For, having caus'd some Humane Blood (being part of the same that was made use of in the Page  33 foregoing Tryals) to be so far dry'd that it was reducible to fine Pow∣der, I took some of this Powder that had past through a fine Search, and casting it through the Flame of a good Candle, the grains in their quick Passage through it took fire, and the Powder flash'd, not without noise, as if it had been Ro∣sin. This Experiment was reiterated with success.
To the VII. Title OF THE HISTORY.
THE specific Gravity of Humane Blood is more difficult to be •etermin'd, than one would readily •magine. For the Gravity of Blood may differ sensibly in several persons Page  34 according to their Sex, Age, Constitu∣tion, &c. And in the same person it may be varyed by the time of the year, and of the day, and by being drawn at a greater or lesser distance from a Meal, and by divers other Circumstances. But besides all these things there is a Mechanical difficul∣ty, if I may so call it, that attends the work we are speaking of. For the Blood begins to coagulate so soon af∣ter it is emitted, that 'tis scarce a practicable thing to weigh it hydro∣statically, either by immersing into it a Solid Body heavier than it self or by weighing the whole Blood in Water; the former way being oppo∣sed by the fibrous part of the Blood, and the latter by the Serum. And up∣on the same account it is somewhat (though not so much) difficult to compare with any accurateness, the weight of Blood, with that of water in a Glass, as also for other reasons which he that shall considerately go about to try it, will quickly find Page  35 But however, since it may be a thing of considerable use, to have some tolerable Estimate, though nor an exact one, of the difference in Gra∣vity between Water and Humane Blood, by which so many parts of the Body, consistent as well as fluid, are by various changes of Tex∣ture both constituted and nourished. I shall subjoyn a Tryal, that this consideration invited me to make as well as I could. We took the Blood of a sound man emitted all at one time, and put the whole mass of it, as well the Serous as the Fibrous part, into an oblong Glass, of the fittest size and shape we could light on amongst several. And have∣ing suffered the Blood to rest till all was setled, and the many Bubbles vanished, we carefully mark'd with a Diamond that narrower part of the Glass, which the upper surface of the Blood reach'd to. Then we weighed the Glass and the Blood in a very good Ballance and having Page  36 poured out the Blood (for other uses) and washed the Glass, it was filled with common Water to the lately mentioned Mark, and then weighed again in the same Ballance; afterwards the Water being poured out, the Glass alone was Counterpoi∣sed in the same scales, and its weight being deducted from each of the two formerly mentioned weights, the Wa∣ter was found to have weighed ℥ix. ʒvi. 50. Gr. And the Blood (equal to it in bulk) to have weigh'd ℥x. ʒij. 4. Gr. So that the difference between them being ʒiij. 14. gr. the Blood was beavier than so much Water, but about the 25th part (for I o∣mit the Fraction) of its own weight. But this Experiment, for the Reasons above intimated, deserves to be reite∣rated more than once.

THough rectified Spirit of Wine be a Menstruum con∣sisting of very subtil parts, and upon that account be a good Dis∣solvent of divers Vegetable Sub∣stances, and as Experience has assured me, of some Metalline ones too, that seem to be more so∣lid than the Fibrous part of Hu∣mane Blood; yet looking upon this Body as of a very differing texture from those, I thought Spirit of Wine might have a very differ∣ing Operation upon it. And accor∣dingly having separated from the Page  38Serum a clot of Blood, that was coa∣gulated but soft enough, as the Fi∣brous part uses to be before 'tis dryd, I kept it for divers hours in a very well dephlegmed Vinous Spirit, from whence I afterwards took it out as hard as if it had been well dry'd by the fire.
To the XIX. Title OF THE HISTORY,
Experiment 1.
THe Volatile Salt of Humane Blood as fugitive as 'tis, is yet so fusible, that if it be dextrously handled, one part of it may be brought to melt, and as I have tryed, even to boil, whilst the rest is flying away. Page  39 The like I have tryed with some o∣ther Volatile Salts, and I presume the Observation will hold in most, if not all of them.
To the same Title, Experiment 2.
THough the Volatile Salt of Hu∣mane Blood, when 'tis by sub∣limation made white and clean, seems to be a very homogeneous Substance and according to the Principles of the Chymists ought to be so; yet I am apt to suspect, either that its Sub∣stance is not altogether Similar, or that the Corpuscles that compose it are of sizes, if not also of shapes, dif∣fering enough. For having weighed out some Grains of a resublimed Salt of Humane Blood, that seemed very pure, the Odour was so strong and Page  40 diffusive, that one would have ex∣pected the whole Salt, being but six Grains, should in a few hours evapo∣rate away, especially being left in a South Window exposed to the Air in a flat piece of Glass. And yet se∣veral days after, if I mistake not seven or eight, I found the Salt so little diminish'd as to its sensible bulk, (for I did not think fit to weigh it) that it seemed to have wasted but lit∣tle, and yet what remained had scarce any odour at all that I (whose Or∣gans of smelling are acute enough) could well perceive, notwithstanding which this White Body retain'd a saline Tast; and a little of it being for tryals sake put upon a solution of common Sublimate in fair Water, rea∣dily turned it White. So that it seem∣ed that the penetrant and diffusive Odour of the Volatile Salt of Blood proceeded from some Particles much more subtile and fugitive than the other parts that composed it. But this Experiment ought to be reiterated Page  41 with differing Quantities of Salt by which means perhaps a heedful ob∣server may discover, whether the comparative Fixity of the Salt, that remains after the Odorous Parti∣cles are (at least for the most part) flown away, may not arise from their Coalition with some Acid Corpuscles that are wont to rove up and down in the Air, and adhere to Bodies, dis∣posed to admit their Action.
To the same Title, Experiment 3.
A dram of Volatile Salt of Humane Blood sublim'd in a lamp fur∣nace, was put into as much common Water, as in a narrow Cylindrical Glass served to cover the whole Ball of our Standard or gag'd Thermoscope, and when after this had stood a while in the Page  42 Water to be brought to its temper, we put in the above mentioned Salt, the tincted Spirit of Wine manifestly sub∣sided about two tenth parts of an Inch, and probably would have fallen lower if there had been more water in the vessel, to make a seasonable solution of the Salt, whereof a consi∣derable part lay undissolved at the bot∣tom.
To the same Title, Experiment 4.
WHen we perceived the Li∣quor to subside no more, we put to it by degrees some strong spirit of Nitre, till it would no longer make any manifest conflict with the dissolved Salt. The event of which Tryal was, that the Liquor in the Page  43 Thermoscope began presently to mount, and continued to do so as long as the conflict lasted, at the end of which we found by measure, that it had ascended more than three Inches and a half above the Station it rested at when the Ebullition began.
To the same Title, Experiment 5.
THe figuration of the Volatile Salt of Humane Blood may be considered, either in regard of the Sin∣gle Grains, or of that Aggregate of them, which when they are made to ascend to the top of the Glass, may be called its Sublimate. The latter of these may be best observed, when the Saline Exhalations first ascend, and fasten themselves to the inside Page  44 of the blind head, or other Glass that is set to receive them. For, though towards the end of the Operation the Corpuscles lye so thick and con∣fus'd, as to leave no distinct figures, yet at first one may often observe the little Saline concretions to lye in Rows, sometimes straight enough, and sometimes more or less crooked, with differing Coherencies and Inter∣ferings, so that though sometimes these Rows of concretions may, espe∣cially if a little befriended by the Spectators fancy, represent either Trees, or their Branches, or Harts-horn, &c. yet these seem not to be constant Representations, depending upon the particular Nature of Humane Blood, but casual figurations that depend upon several accidental causes and cir∣cumstances, such as the degree of Fire employ'd to sublime the Salt, the plenty or paucity of the ascend∣ing Matter the capacity and figure of the vessel that receives it, besides several others not needful to be here Page  45 enumerated. Nor is the Salt of Hu∣mane Blood the only Volatile one, among whose elevated concretions I have observed the above named Cir∣cumstances to produce diversity of Configurations. But as to single grains of the Volatile Salt of Blood, I dis∣cerned a good many of them to be finely shap'd. But whether it were accidental or not, further Tryal must inform me. I could not, that I re∣member, observe these handsom Figures in the concretions that com∣pos'd the Sublimate, that was ob∣tained by rectifying or elevating a∣gain the Salt that first came over, but in the grains that in the first Destillation fasten themselves to the upper part and sides of the Receiver; For of these divers were of conside∣rable bigness and solidity, and though they were not all of the same shape, some of them being not unlike to Cubes, others to Parallelopipeds, others to Octoedrons,being almost like Grains of Alum; yet most of them Page  46 were prettily shaped, being compre∣hended by Planes smooth, finely fi∣gur'd, and aptly terminating in solid Angles, as if the Concretions had been cut and polished by a Jeweller.
To the same Title, Experiment 6.
THere is another way that I have used to observe the Figures of the Salt of Blood which was to rectify the Spirit of Blood, so as it may be fully satiated with the Salt whilst the Liquor (in the Receiver continued yet somewhat warm. For then setting aside this over impreg¦nated Liquor when it came to be quite refrigerated (which should be done very slowly) there appear'd at the bottom of the Vial a good num¦ber of Saline concretions of differing Page  47 Sizes, several of which, as far as the rest would suffer me to see them, were shot into Crystalline Plates very smooth, and prettily figur'd, having to the best of my conjecture, their broad and parallel Surfaces of a Hexagonal or an Octogonal Figure re∣gular enough.
To the same Title, Experiment 7.
ACcording to the Hypothesis of divers Learned Naturalists and Physicians, I suppos'd it would be thought considerable, to know what would happen upon putting together the Volatile Salt of Humane Blood, and the Spirit of Nitre, with the more fugitive parts of which Salt they conceive the Air to be plenti∣fully, and some of them to be vitally impregnated.
Page  48To gratify some of these Philo∣sophers, we took a dram of dry Volatile Salt of Blood, (which we made choice of, rather than Spirit, because we had a mind to know what quantity of Acid Salt it would re∣tain;) and having dissolv'd it in some distill'd Water, we drop'd into it good Spirit of Nitre, till the two Liquors, thô they were shaken, would no longer manifestly act up∣on one another; the Conflict being ceas'd, we slowly evaporated the superfluous moisture, which steam'd almost all away before the Saline part would coagulate. At length it came to driness, and then the middlemost part appear'd in the form of thin Crystals, not unlike those of Salt Petre; but the rest, which was by much the greater part of the concre∣tion seem'd to be a confus'd mass without any distinct figure. This mass weighed but 12 gr. more than a dram. So that as far as this single Experiment can inform us, the Vola∣tile Page  49 Salt of Blood may be satiated by so little as a Fifth part of its weight of the Saline Corpuscles of Spirit of Nitre. This compounded Salt be∣ing laid in a Window, did appear to be very prone to be resolv'd by the moisture of the Air, or in the Chymists Phrase to run per deliquium. A little of the same Salt being put up∣on a well-kindled Coal, readily melt∣ed, and seem'd to boil, and towards the latter end, made a noise, and af∣forded a flame very like common Nitre, save that its colour was more yellow. The strong smell that ac∣companied this deflagration, was like that which is peculiar to Spirit of Nitre.

To the XXI. Title OF THE HISTORY,
Experiment 1.
HUmane Blood, as most of the other Subjects of the Animal Kingdom that I have had occasion to examine, afforded by Distillation in a Retort an Empyreumatical and very fetid Oyl, whose colour was almost black; but that seem'd to me to proceed only from the intense and opacous Redness of the Liquor, since some Portions of it being purposely look'd on against the Light, when they were spread very thin upon Glass, ap∣pear'd of a deep yellow, or of a Red∣dish colour, as they chanc'd to lye more or less thick upon the Glass.
Page  51
Experiment 2.
WHen the Blood was well dry'd, before it was com∣mitted to Distillation, I found it to afford a greater quantity of Oyl, in proportion to the weight of the dry Body, than was at first expected. Once out of a pound of not over-well dry'd Blood, we had near an ounce and a half of Oil; and from another parcel we had it in a far greater pro∣portion to the quantity of Blood that afforded it.
Experiment 3.
I Remember, that having many years ago had the curiosity to •repare Blood by a very convenient Digestion, and to rectifie very care∣fully Page  52 the Distill'd Liquors that came over, with the Flame of a Lamp, I obtain'd among other things two Oyls of very differing colours, the one being of a Yellow or pale Amber colour, and the other of a deep Red. But that which surpriz'd even inge∣nious Spectators, was, that thô these Oils were both of them afforded by the same Blood, and were clear and pure enough, yet they would not only swim in distinct Masses one over another, but if they were con∣founded by being shaken together, would little by little separate again, as common Oil and Water are wont to do. Whether the difference in Specifick Gravity between these two Oils could keep them from perma∣nently mixing, when they were mingled, as well as it kept their Masses distinct before they were shaken; or whether this seeming Antipathy proceeded from some par∣ticular Incongruity in the Textures of these Liquors, I shall not now stay to dispute.
Page  53
Experiment 4.
IT may be of some use, especially to those that aim at making Me∣dicinal uses of Humane Blood, to know, that having had a suspicion that the Oil of Blood might con∣tain or conceal divers Saline Particles, capable of being separated from it; we took a parcel of unrectifi'd Oil, and having put to it a convenient quantity of Distill'd Water (I suppose Rain-water would have done as well, thô common Water would not) we diligently confounded these Liquors by frequent agitation, that the Wa∣ter might rob the Oil of its sepa∣rable Saline Corpuscles. Of which Trial the Event was, that after the Liquors were well settled, the Water (whereof we purposely forbore to employ too much) was found im∣pregnated with Saline Corpuscles, Page  54 that it had by dissolution obtain'd from the Oil, by vertue of which it was endowed with a moderately brisk tast, and would readily turn Syrup of Violets green, and precipi∣tate out of a Solution of common Sublimate a white Powder, to name now no other of its resemblances to weak Spirit of Humane Blood. And this operation I the more willingly relate on this occasion, that you may be invited to try what the like Me∣thod will do on other Empyreuma∣tical Oils, as of Hartshorn, Urine, &c. drawn from Bodys that belong to the Animal Kingdom.
Experiment 5.
TO examine a Conjecture, whose Grounds I cannot stay to set down, we put some unrectified Oil of Humane Blood into a concave piece of Glass, and then having Page  55 dropt into it as much Oil of Vitriol as might by guess amount to a fourth or third part of the Fetid Oil, we stirr'd them well together with a slender piece of solid Glass, by which means the mixture was made to send up good store of whitish Fumes or Smoke, and grew, as was expect∣ed, considerably hot, it being indeed so hot, that thô it amounted not to above a spoonful, yet I was not able without pain & inconvenience, to hold my finger underneath that part of the Glass that contain'd the incales∣cent Liquors.
Experiment 6.
IT may be worth while to relate, that what I have elsewhere ob∣serv'd about some other Empyreuma∣tical Oils, holds true in that of Hu∣mane Blood: For having taken some of this Liquor unrectifi'd, thô in Page  56 that state it appear'd gross, and dark, and muddy, yet it would readily, even in the cold, dissolve in, or mingle with highly rectifi'd Vinous Spirits, to which it communicated a Reddish colour deep enough, agreeably to what I formerly noted touching the colour of this Oil.
To the XXII. Title OF THE HISTORY.
I do not remember to have met with, in any Author, an account of the Qualities of the fix'd Salt of Humane Blood, and I know not whether any have had the curiosity to prepare it, whereat I do not much wonder, since to obtain so much as ℥j. Of it there is requisite a considera∣ble Page  57 quantity, perhaps some pounds of Blood, and the Calcination re∣quires so obstinate a fire, that a mans patience may easily be tired before the Operation be perfected, or by the small appearance of Calcination that the Caput Mortuum will afford him after having been kept Three or Four hours in the fire, he may be induc'd to conclude that all the Salt of Blood is volatile in a good Fire, and conse∣quently, that it will yield no fix'd Salt.
But having by an obstinate Calci∣nation obtain'd between Three or Four Drams of this Salt, I found not that it was a fix'd Alcaly or a Lixi∣viate Salt, but rather as I expected, of the nature of common or Sea-Salt, thô not without some little diversity which discover'd itself by some nice Tryals. But as to the main our Salt was scarce distinguishable from ma∣rin Salt, for it tasted very like it, a strong Solution of it did not readily (for I was not at leisure to wait Page  58 long for the Event) turn Syrup of Violets green or greenish, nor (which was more) Precipitate a Brick Colour or brownish Yellow, no more than a white Powder, out of Solution of Sub∣limate. I also found by Tryal that the Spirit of Salt did not dissolve it as an Alcaly. And to these ways of exa∣mining it I added three others, that I had not known us'd for such a pur∣pose, and which had all three of them such Events as were expected, for having put some Oyl of Vitriol upon a little of our dry Salt, it did imme∣diately, as I had divers times obser∣v'd it to do upon common Salt, corrode it with great violence, and with much foam and smoak. We also drop'd a little of our fix't Salt dissolved in di∣stilled water, upon a Solution of fine Silver made in Aqua Fortis, whereupon immediately ensued a Precipitation of a copious white Powder. And lastly for further Tryal, having put some leaf Gold into Aqua fortis, which would not (as will easily be Page  59 believ'd) work upon it, whilst it was swimming there without being so much as discolour'd, I put a little of our Powder'd Salt into the Liquor, which being thereby turned into a kind of Aqua Regia, did in a trice, without the assistance of heat, totally dissolve it.
To the XXIII. Title OF THE HISTORY OF Humane Blood.
THere is a far greater Calcination than one would expect, re∣quired to obtain the Caput MortuumPage  60 of Humane Blood, which affords but very little of it. For from ℥xxiv. of dry'd Blood, (which perhaps was but the Third or Fourth part, in weight of the entire Blood that af∣forded it) we could get after two days Calcination but ʒij.9 gr. of Earth. And though this were so carefully made that it may very probably be supposed to deserve the name of Ter∣ra Damnata, better then most substan∣ces to which Chymists are wont to give that appellation, yet one may suspect, that this it self was not pure Elementary earth, since it had a red colour, very like that of Colcotar of Vitriol.

To the VXXI. Title OF THE HISTORY.
THe Quantities of the Principles, or rather of the Several differ∣ing Substances, obtain'd by Distilla∣tion from Humane Blood, may seem easy, but is indeed very difficult, if at all possible, to be determin'd not only because of the sometimes great dis∣parity, as to proportion, that may be met with of the Fibrous, or con∣creted part to the Serum, in the Blood of differing Persons, and even of the same Person according to dif∣fering Circumstances, but also, be∣cause it is more difficult to distill e∣ven the dryed and pulverable part of Blood without addition, than those Page  62 that have not try'd, will easily judge, and I doubt that few have try'd it well, because I have not met with any that takes notice of the necessity of shifting the Retort, to gain as much Volatile Substance as may be obtain'd, and leave as little as may be in the Caput Mortuum. For when we distill'd a somewhat considerable quantity of dry'd Blood, though it was warily done by an expert Ar∣tist, yet the same heat, that made the lower part of the Blood pass in the form of Exhalations into the Recei∣ver, made the matter so swell, that it heav'd up to the upper part of the vessel a considerable quantity of Black Matter, which an ordinary Di∣stiller would have taken and thrown aside for Caput Mortuum, but which an heedful Eye might easily discern to be much of the same nature with what it was, when it was first put in, though it were blackened by the as∣cending fumes. Wherefore we took it out and mixing it with the remain∣ing Page  63 Substance, that was less remote from the Nature of a true Caput Mor∣tuum, it was again in another Retort committed to Distillation, whereby we obtain'd more Oyl, &c. And per∣ceiving that even this seeming Ca∣put Mortuum, had at the top of it a pretty deal of matter, that I did not think sufficiently dispirited, if I may so speak, I caused it to be taken out and distill'd in a fresh Retort, in which it afforded a not contemptible quanti∣ty of Volatile matter.
Having thus prepar'd you not to ex∣pect any thing of accurateness, in the determination of the Quantities of the differing substances obtainable even from dryed Humane Blood, that I may assist you to make some guess at it, that may approach somewhat •ear the truth, I will inform you, That having thus in three Retorts distill'd 24 Ounces of dryed Hu∣mane Blood, we obtained of Volatile •ubstances, I mean Spirit together with a little Phlegm, white Salt, and Page  64 very high coloured Oyl ℥xiij. and a dram, besides several Parcels of thick Oyl, that stuck to the Retorts and the Receiver, which we estimated at Se∣ven drams more. So that the whole quantity of the Volatile part amount∣ed to Fourteen Ounces, of which we found the Oyl to be about ℥iij. + ʒvj. And the clear Liquor (which though probably not without some Phlegm, may deserve the name of Spirit, be∣cause it was fully satiated with Saline and Spirituous parts) to be ℥vi +. ʒiijss. besides the Volatile Salt, which when the Spirit was drain'd from it, appear'd white, but wet; for which reason 'twas not possible to determine exactly, neither how much Liquor it yet retain'd, nor con∣sequently how much it self weighed but you may guess pretty near the truth when I shall have told you, that having carefully sublim'd the Salt, there remain'd in the glass ʒij and about five grains of Phlegmatick Li∣quor, which was not judged devoid Page  65 of Salt, thô it could not by that ope∣ration be separated. And of Vola∣tile Salt in a dry form we obtain'd ℥j + ʒijss. The Caput Mortuum a∣mounted to ℥viij, and somewhat bet∣ter, which being calcin'd for two days together, afforded not white, but only brownish red Ashes; whence we obtain'd ʒvij and a quarter of White and Fixt,* but not truly Lixi∣viate, Salt, and (as was lately noted to another purpose, under the next foregoing Title) ʒij, and nine grains of Earth. In this troublesom Experiment there occurr'd so many necessary Opera∣tions, in each of which we could scarce possibly avoid losing some, and now and then a considerable portion of the matters we handled, that if you had been present at the Tryals, perhaps you would not think it strange that I should write, (as I did a little above) that I think it a very difficult thing in Practice, to deter∣mine Page  66 exactly the Proportions of the differing Substances, that may be chy∣mically obtain'd by vulgarly known Operations, from a proposed parcel of Humane Blood; especially since I think that 'tis without sufficient grounds that Chymists do universal∣ly take it for granted, that in Distil∣lations carefully made, the matter that passes into the Receiver, or at least ascends, together with the Re∣mains, or Caput Mortuum, amount to just the weight that the entire Bo∣dy had before Distillation. Which Paradox I endeavour to make highly probable, if not certain, in another Paper, that belongs not to the pre∣sent Collection.

The Third Part, Containing Promiscuous Experiments and Observations about the Se∣rum of healthy Mans Blood; (Whereof the first may be referr'd to the Sixteenth, and most of the rest to the Seventeenth of the Titles of the first Order.)
SInce the Division that Nature her self makes of Humane Blood, when being let out of the Veins, it is suffer'd to refrigerate and settle, is, into a fluid or Serous, and a consistent or Fibrous part; and since 'tis found that oftentimes the former of these Parts either equals or exceeds the latter in quantity; I thought it might probably much conduce to the bet∣ter discovery of the Nature of the Page  68 Blood, to make some Tryals upon the Serum by it self, of which it will not, I hope, be useless to give a summary account in the following promiscuous Observations, that were made only upon the Serum, or Whey of the Blood of Persons presum'd to be sound.
1. Having separately weighed the Serum, and the Consistent Part of a parcel of Humane Blood, obtained at once by a single Phlebotomy, we found the latter to weigh ℥iv + ʒviss. and the former ℥iij + ʒvj. And ha∣ving made the like Tryal with ano∣ther parcel of Blood drawn from ano∣ther person, the Fibrous part weighed ℥iv + ʒv, and the Serum four ounces. But thô in both these Tryals the weight of Serum that appear'd in one Mass, was inferiour to that of the Fibrous Part, yet it would not be safely inferr'd, that, absolutely speak∣ing, the Fibrous part of either of these parcels of Blood exceeded the other, since we weighed only the SerumPage  69 that we found in a distinct Mass; whereas a multitude of Serous Par∣ticles may well be suppos'd to be lodg'd between the Parts of the Consistent Mass or Portion of the Blood; since besides that it is, pro∣bably upon the account of the Inter∣spersed Serosity, very soft, it affords a great deal of Aqueous Liquor.
2. This may sufficiently appear by the following Experiment, which was purposely made to examine this Conjecture.
We took a Porrenger of Blood, wherein the Serum was separated from the Fibrous Portion, that was coagulated into one Consistent Mass, and having carefully pour'd off all the fluid part, we put the remaining Mass, (which weighed ℥iv. + ʒ v + 34 gr.) into a small Head and Body, and distill'd it in the Digestive Fur∣nace, till the Matter left in the bot∣tom of the Cucurbite was quite dry, which it did appear to be long be∣fore it was so indeed. Then taking Page  70 out the separated Parts of this Red Mass, the dry'd Portion was found to weigh but ℥j + ʒiij + 34 gr. where∣as the Serous Liquor that pass'd into the Receiver, and was lympid and aqueous, without any shew of Salt or Oyl, amounted to ℥iij + 53 gr.
For further satisfaction we repeated this Experiment with the Fibrous part of another parcel of Humane Blood, and found the dry Mass re∣maining in the Cucurbite to weigh but ℥j + ʒvj + 50 gr. whereas the Phlegmatick Liquor distill'd from it amounted to ℥vij, that is to more than three times and a half as much as the dry part.
3. Having Hydrostatically exa∣min'd the Serum of Humane Blood, we found it heavier than common Water. For a piece of Red Sealing-Wax, being suspended in a good Ballance by a Horse-hair, was found in the Air to weigh ʒj + 56. gr. and the Water 35 gr. but did in the Se∣rum weigh but 33 gr.
Page  71This Tryal was confirm'd by a more exact one, made with an In∣strument that I purposely caus'd to be made for weighing Liquors nice∣ly, in which, when Common Wa∣ter weighed 253 grains, an equal bulk of Serum weighed 302. And because I suppos'd that all Serums of Humane Blood would not be of equal Specific Gravity, I thought fit to try that of the Blood of another person in the same Instrument, and found it to weigh two grains less, that is, 300 grains in all.
4. We once employ'd some Serum that could not be (or at least was not) pour'd off so clear, but that it appear'd of a reddish colour; and thô we filter'd it through Cap-paper, yet a good number of the tinging Corpuscles were so throughly ming∣led with it, that the Liquor passd through the Filtre of a Yellow Colour.
5. To try whether Acids would coagulate our Serum, as I had found they would some other Animal Li∣quors, Page  72 I dropt into it some Spirit of Salt, which did immediately pro∣duce with it some white Concretions that quickly subsided to the bottom, and there (when there was a pretty quantity of them) appear'd like a ve∣ry light and tender Cheese-Curd.
The like Operation, but more powerful had Oyl of Vitriol upon another parcel of our Serum.
6. We dropt into some of our Li∣quor, good Spirit of Sal-Armoniac, which, as we expected, rather made it more Fluid, than did appear to coagulate it, as the Acid Liquors had done.
7. To try whether these Precipi∣tations did not more proceed from the Coalition and Texture of the Acid Salts and the Serum, than bare∣ly from the peculiar action of those Salts as Acids, we dropt into another portion of our Serum, a strong Alca∣lisate Salt, viz. Oyl of Tartar per deliquium, which instantly produc'd a White Curd, as the Spirit of Salt Page  73 had done, but not, as it seem'd to us, so copiously.
8. We pour'd also upon some Se∣rum, highly rectifi'd Spirit of Wine, which, as we expected, did present∣ly coagulate some part of it into a White Curd, that was copious enough, but appear'd much lighter than either of the former, since it would not like them subside, but kept at the top of the Liquor.
9. To try also what a Salt com∣pounded with a Metal, would do upon our Serum, we put to it a little strong Solution of Sublimate, with which it presently afforded a white and curdled substance.
We put some of our Serum upon some Filings of Mars, but by rea∣son of the colour of the Liquor it self, we could not satisfie our selves about the Event. And thô we af∣terwards put another parcel of Se∣rum upon Filings of the same Metal, yet neither did this give us satisfa∣ction, in regard the Vial having been Page  74 mislaid, was not look'd upon again till many days after; at which time the Liquor was grown so thick and muddy, that we could not well dis∣cern any more of the colour, than that it was somewhat dark, but not either black or blackish; yet by a Tryal or two that we made with a little of this Liquor, it seem'd to have made a Solution of some part of the Steel: For putting it to some fresh Infusion of Galls made with Water, it presently afforded a co∣pious Precipitate; but this was so far from being Inky, that it was not so much as dark colour'd, but rather whitish; at which some ana∣logous Experiments (mentioned in another Treatise) that I formerly made, kept me from wondering. Yet I shall not omit to add on this occasion, that having mix'd with some of our impregnated Serum, a convenient quantity of Infusion of Galls made in a highly rectifi'd Vi∣nous Spirit, the two Liquors did not Page  75 only afford a kind of Coagulum, or Precipitate, but being left together for some hours, associated into a Consistent Body, wherein the Eye discover'd no distinct Liquor at all.
10. But expecting more clear suc∣cess, by putting some of our Liquor upon Filings of Copper, which when wrought upon by Bodys that have in them any thing of Urinous Salt, are wont to give a conspicuous Tincture, we accordingly found that the Metal had in a very few hours discolour'd the Menstruum; and af∣terwards (the Vial being left unstopt, that the Air might have Access to the Liquor) it began by degrees to grow more and more Blew, and with∣in a day after was of a deep Ceru∣leous Colour.
11. And, to be confirm'd in our Conjecture, that this Tincture pro∣ceeded from some Particles of Vola∣tile Salt latent in the Liquor, we mix'd some of it with a convenient quantity of Syrup of Violets, and Page  76 thereby obtain'd what we look'd for, namely, a colour, which by reason of the action of those Particles upon the Syrup, appear'd of a fine Green.
12. The Blew Tincture or Solu∣tion of Copper (mention'd number the 10th) I thought fit to keep for some time, to try whether the Metal∣line Particles would as it were em∣balm the Serum they were dispers'd through, and preserve the Liquor from Putrefaction. And in Effect, thô the Vial was left unstopt in a window in my Bed-Chamber for many weeks, yet I (whose Organs of smelling are very tender, and who did often put the Vial to my Nose) did not perceive the Liquor to grow at all stinking.
13. About ℥ij, by guess of Serum of Humane Blood were left in an unstop'd vial, (which they more then half fill'd) for Twenty days or Three weeks and though the Glass usually stood in a South Window, and in the month of July, yet, somewhat Page  77 to our wonder, the Serum did not by the smell appear putrefy'd, and yet had let fall a considerable quantity of Whitish Sediment. But within Three or Four days after this, the Liquor was found to stink offensively. Wherefore we tryed whether this more then incipient Putrefaction was accompanyed with any Acidity, but could not perceive that it was, since it would not so much as take off the blew colour of the infusion of Lignum Nephriticum or our Succedaneum to it. When it was in this state we put it to distill in a low Cucurbite with a gen∣tle fire, to try if from this faetid Li∣quor, as is usual from putrefy'd U∣rine, the Spirit would first ascend. But we found the Liquor that first came over to be so little Spirituous or Saline, that it would not in an hours time turn Syrup of Violets green. But yet we judg'd it not quite destitute of Volatile Alcaly, because having let fell some of it into a good solution of Sublimate, it presently made at White Precipitate.
Page  7814. We took some Ounces of Se∣rum of Humane Blood, filtred through Cap Paper to free it from all concreted Substance, and having committed it to Distillation in a small Retort place'd in a Sand Furnace, we obtained only a few large drops of a Darkish red Oyl, some of which subsided to the bottom of the other Liquor, but the greater part swam upon it. We obtain'd in this first Distillation no Volatile Salt in a dry form, but after a pretty deal of insipid Phlegm had been drawn off, there came over a good proportion of Spirituous Liquor, which smell'd almost like the Spirit of Blood; and contain'd a pretty deal of Volatile Alcaly, so that it would readily turn Syrup of Violets Green, and make a White Precipitate in the solution of Sublimate, and a great Ebullition with Spirit of Salt: This Spirit being rectifyed in a small Head and Body, there was left in the bottom of the Glass a greater quantity than was ex∣pected Page  79 of a substance thick like Honey, and which was for the most part of a dark Red, and seem'd to contain more Oyl than appeared upon the first Distillation. The Liquor that came over the Helm, seem'd more pure, but not very much stronger. than the first Spirit. Yet, having put it into a Glass Egg with a slender neck, and given the vessel a conveni∣ent situation in hot Sand, we obtain'd a Volatile Alcaly that sublim'd into the neck in the form of a White Salt. If this Tryal be reiterated with a success like that I have now recited, 'twill seem to argue that the Serous or Fluid part of the Blood affords the same Elementary Principles or Similar Substances, both as to num∣ber and kind, that the Fibrous and Consistent part does, though not as to quantity, that of the Oyl and dry Salt being less in a determinate por∣tion of Serum, than they would be in a like quantity or weight of the concreted part of the Blood.
Page  80Having long since observ'd, that though the Spirituous parts of Mans Urine are wont to require that the Liquor be digested or putrefy'd a∣bout Six weeks, to loosen them from the more sluggish parts, and make them ascend before the Phlegm, yet if fresh Urine be pour'd upon a due proportion of Quick-lime, a good part of the Spirit will presently be untyed, and made capable of ascend∣ing in Distillation, I thought it worth while to try, what would be afford∣ed by the Serum of Humane Blood if it were put upon Quick-lime, be∣fore we distill'd it. In pursuit of this Enquiry, we put these two Bodies together, upon whose commixture there ensued (but not presently) a sensible but transient heat. This com∣pounded Body being committed to distillation afforded first a kind of Phlegm in a gentle fire, and then in a stronger, a moderate quantity of Liquor that was thought to smell manifestly of the Lime, but had not Page  81 a brisk tast. This was accompany'd with somewhat more of high coloured & faetid Oil than was expected. The other Liquor being slowly rectify'd, the Spirit that first came over had a strong and piercing smell, but less rank than that of Humane Blood drawn the ordinary way. Its tast also was not only quick, but somewhat fiery. Being dropt upon Syrup of Vio¦lets, it presently turn'd it green, with a strong Solution of Sublimate in Wa∣ter, and another of Quick-silver in Aqua Fortis, it immediately made two White Precipitates. And being mingled with some good Spirit of Sea-Salt though upon their being con∣founded there appear'd a thick but whitish Smoke, there was not pro∣duc'd any visible conflict or Bubbles. Yet the Colour of the Spirit of Salt, appear'd much heightn'd by this O∣peration. But here I must, though not in due place, take notice, that having put the lately mentioned mixture of the Spirit of Serum and of Salt to Page  82 evaporate, that we might observe whether it would afford a Salt much figur'd like Sal-armoniac; we found, that it did not, bot that the Colour produc'd in the Mixture whilst fluid, was so heightned in the concretion we speak of, that it appeared of a Blood-red Colour, but for the shape, it was so confus'd, that we could not reduce it to any known kind of Salt. By all which Phoenomena this Spirit of the Serous part of Blood, seems to be very near of kin to that of the con∣creted part of Blood, elsewhere by us described. Because Quick-lime is wont to be suspected by Physicians, by reason of its Caustick and Fretting Quality, I thought fit to try whether the Fixt Salt of Pota-shes (which is a Lixiviate Alcaly as well as Lime,) being substituted in the Room of it, would in Distillation have the same Effect upon Serum of Humane Blood. Wherefore to Four parts of the Li∣quor, we put one of the Salt, and hav∣ing Distill'd them slowly in a Glass Page  83 Head and Body, we obtain'd good store of a Liquor, which was not judg'd any thing near so strong, as that formerly mention'd to have been drawn off from Quick-lime. And having put this weak Liquor, afforded by our Serum, to rectify with a gentle heat, we found that e∣ven the two spoonfuls of Liquor that first ascended, were not Spirituous, but very Phlegmatick. Nor would it well turn Syrup of Violets Green, though it afforded some little and light Precipitate, when it was put up∣on a Solution of Sublimate.
This may seem somewhat the more remarkable, if I add on this occasion an Experiment, that may be sometimes of Practical use, espe∣cially in Physick, and may afford much Light to those that are studious, to know the Nature and Preparations of so very useful a Subject, as Hu∣mane Ʋrine. We took three parts of fresh Urine, (that was not many hours old) and having put into it one Page  84 part of Salt of Pot-ashes, (because that was at hand, for else I presume the fixt Salt of Tartar, or even of Common Wood ashes, would have served the turn) and having slowly distill'd them in a Head and Body, there first ascended a Liquor Spiritu∣ous enough; which being set aside, We continued the Distillation (after having poured the Mixture into a Retort) till the Remains appeared dry. In this operation it is to be not∣ed; that we obtain'd not one drop of Oyl; and that (perhaps for that rea∣son) this Spirit of Urine was not near so faetid, as being made the Common way 'tis wont to be: and that the Liquor that came over to∣ward the latter end of the Distillati∣on, was so unlike that which the Serum of Blood afforded us, that it was not only considerably strong, and manifestly stronger than that which first ascended, but had a pene∣trating and fiery Tast, which left a lasting Impression upon the Tongue; Page  85 and with good Spirit of Salt made a notable Ebullition, which I remem∣ber not, that upon Tryals purposely made, I found the Spirit of Urine drawn from Quicklime to have done. And, whereas with this last mentio∣ned Liquor, I never (that I remem∣ber) found any Volatile Salt to a∣scend (in a dry form) in the opera∣tion made by the help of Salt of Pot-ashes, there came up without Recti∣fication, divers Grains of Volatile Salt, one of which was Crystalline, and considerably large; so that we could with pleasure observe it to be like a Plate curiously figur'd; but because of some lesser Corns of Salt, that hid one part of it, I could not clearly discern whether it were Hexa∣gonal or Octogonal.
But here I must not conceal, that having for greater certainty reitera∣ted this Experiment, it had not so good success; the Liquor that came over ap∣pearing much more Phlegmatick, than that which the former Tryal afford∣ed Page  86 us; tho we both times employ'd Salt of Pot-ashes taken out of the same Vessel, and the Urine of the same Person. So that what the rea∣son of the difference may be, does not yet occur to me; but perhaps will upon further Tryals: yet this Liquor, that appear'd so weak at its first coming over, being rectified per se, afforded more than was ex∣pected of a Brisk Saline Spirit, from which we easily obtain'd a pretty quantity (in proportion to the Li∣quor) of Volatile Salt in a dry form, and of a very White Colour.
We took between two and three Ounces of Serum of Humane Blood, and having put it into a Bolthead, capable by our guess of containing about four times as much Liquor, and having seal'd the Glass Hermetically, set it by, as well to observe whether any manifest Changes would appear in it within a Week or two, (of which none in that time occurr'd to us) as for some other Purposes, that may be Page  87 guess'd at by the following Account of the Event.
1. After we had kept the Liquor seal'd up above a whole Year, it did not appear to be at all coagulated, nor to have let fall any manifest Re∣sidence; but seem'd to be as fluid as when it was first put in.
2. It did not appear to have bred any the least Worm or Maggot. And this I the rather take notice of, be∣cause it agrees very well with what I have elsewhere alledg'd, in disfa∣vour of their Opinion, that think, all the fluid and soft Parts of Humane Bodies do naturally, and of them∣selves, in no long time breed Worms, or some such Insects; which, for my part, I never observ'd to be genera∣ted in Blood it self, though very long kept, and putrified, provided it were fresh enough when put into the Glass, and by an exact Closure kept from being any way blown upon by Flies, or impregnated by Seminal Particles, that may be unsuspected∣ly Page  88 convey'd to it by the Air.
3. Nor did there appear to the Eye any Mother, as they call it, or Recre∣mentitious Substance, that is suppos'd in Liquors always to accompany, and betoken Putrefaction.
4. One of my Designs, in our Ex∣periment, being to try whether the Serum would, by the mutual Action of the Parts upon one another, or by that of some Catholick, permea∣ting Fluid, afford so much Air as would either crack, or more violent∣ly break the Glass; the Tip at which the Bolt-head was seal'd, was warily taken off with a Key, whereupon there rush'd out a pretty deal of Air, with a considerable noise: And I doubted not that this generated (or at least extricated) Air, had been considerably compress'd whilst it was pent up; when casting my Eyes on the Liquor, to discover what change this Eruption had made there, I per∣ceiv'd on the upper Surface of the Liquor a multitude of small Bubbles, Page  89 such as are wont to be seen in Drink a little Bottled, upon the opening of the Vessel; and also in divers Li∣quors, after the Air has been pent up with them, when the Glasses come to be unstopp'd. And I also the less wonder'd at this, because I remember'd what formerly hapned to me, after having seal'd up some Sheeps Blood, and kept it for several Days in a gentle warmth; for, tho the Glass it was enclos'd in, were far larger than this that contained our Serum; yet after some time, when no Body offer'd any violence to it, or was near enough to stir it, it was suddenly blown up with a sur∣prizing noise by the Aereal or Elasti∣cal Corpuscles that were produced, or set free by the Putrefaction we discover'd to have been made.
5. The smell of our Serum was strong, but not Cadaverous, but ra∣ther resembled that of the Tincture of Sulphur made with Salt of Tartar and Spirit of Wine, or of some such Page  90 Sulphureous Preparation.
6. One of the chief aims I had in keeping our Serum so long Seal'd up, was to try, whether by a Digestion, or Putrefaction for some Months, the Serum of Blood would like Urine (which is commonly thought to be a Liquor made of it, and of very near Cognation to it) afford a Saline Spi∣rit, or an Alcaly Volatile enough to ascend before the Phlegm. And in pursuit of this enquiry we commit∣ted our Serum to Distillation in a small Glass Head and Body, and in a Digestive Furnace, being careful to take the first Spoonful, or there∣abouts of Spirit that passed into the Receiver: But we found, that, tho this Liquor at first smell'd strong e∣nough, (I say at first, because the Odour soon after grew fainter) yet the tast was not at all brisk nor Spi∣rituous like that wont to be obtain'd by Distillation from Putrify'd Urine. Nor did our Liquor being drop'd into a little Syrup of Violets, give it pre∣sently Page  91 any manifest greenness. But yet, because I found it not insipid, I thought fit to examine it a little more critically, and dropt a convenient quantity of it into a clear and Satu∣rate Solution of Sublimate in Com∣mon Water, by which means there was produc'd a whiteness like that (but not near so dense) which Spirit of Urine, or Volatile Salt would have produc'd. And by this I was invited to mix some of it with a little Syrup of Violets upon a piece of White Paper, and also to wet with the same (Distill'd) Liquor, some small filings of Copper spread upon ano∣ther piece of Paper, and to leave them both all Night in the open Air, that the Liquor might have time e∣nough to work upon the Syrup, and the Metal. By which course we found in the Morning, that the for∣mer was turn'd green, and the latter was so far dissolv'd as to leave a large blewish stain upon the Paper. I mention these things the rather, Page  92 because according to the Opinion of some Learned Men, this degenera∣ted Serum should have been of an Acid, not an Alcalisate nature.
7. The near Cognation that, ac∣cording to some Learned Physicians, there is between Milk, and the more Serous part of the Blood, invited me to try whether, (according to an Ex∣periment made on New Milk, that I have heard ascribed to the famous Sylvius,) our Serum of Humane Blood would grow Red, by being kept continually stirring over a mo∣derate heat with a competent quanti∣ty of Salt of Tartar, but in two try∣als, we found not any redness pro∣duc'd, tho one of them was made in a Vessel of refin'd Silver, with an eighth part of the Salt in reference to the Serum, which was the same proportion that we had us'd when we made the Experiment succeed well in Milk.
8. Perhaps it will be needless to take notice, that the Serum of Hu∣mane Page  93 Blood will by heat be in a short time coagulated into a kind of Gelly, or rather, as far as I have observ'd, into a Substance like a Custard, as to Consistence, tho not as to Colour. And therefore I shall now add, that having found that Acid Spirits also would coagulate Serum. I thought fit to try, whe∣ther Alcalys would not oppose, or re∣tard its Coagulation. Of which Try∣al the event was, that having put Spirit of Humane Blood to a conve∣nient quantity of Serum, and caus'd them to be kept stirring over a very gentle Fire, though the Volatile Al∣caly did not hinder the Coagulation, yet it seem'd to make it both more slow, and more soft or laxe. And this effect was yet more considera∣ble, when we try'd another parcel of Serum with Salt of Tartar instead of Spirit of Blood.

The Fourth Part, Containing the History of the Spirit of Humane Blood Begun; In an Epistolary Discourse to the very Learned Dr. J. L.
Sir,
HAving by want of leisure and opportunity, been reduced to treat of the History of Humane Blood in so imperfect and desultory a way, that several of the Titles have been left wholly untouch'd, and others have been but transiently and jejunely treated of; I thought fit to handle more fully, some one of the Primary Titles, and branch it into its several subordinate or secundary Titles. And for this purpose I pitch'd upon the Spirit of Humane Page  95 Blood, being willing on so noble a Subject to give a Specimen of what might have been done to Illustrate the other Primary Titles, if some requisites had not been wanting. And since the Spirit of Humane Blood is at least one of the noblest of Urinous or Volatile Alcalies; so that most of the things that shall be taught concerning that, may with some little variation be apply'd to Spirit of Urine, Hartshorn, Sal-Ar∣moniac, Soot, &c. I thought fit to lay down a Scheme of subordinate Titles, whose Heads (which amount to above half the number of the Primary ones, that belong to the whole History of Blood) should be so numerous and comprehensive, that this Paper may pass not only for an Example, but for a kind of summa∣ry of the History of Volatile Salts in general, and so supply the loss of a Paper that I once begun on that Subject.
And now I should without further Page  96 Preamble proceed to the intended History, but that I think it requisite to premise three or four short Advertise∣ments. Whereof the First shall be, That the Spirit I employ'd in making the following Tryals and Observations, was drawn from Humane Blood without any Sand, Clay, or other Additament, (save perhaps that by a mistake that could do no mischief, a small parcel had some Vinous Spi∣rit put to it to preserve it a while) and that the first distillations (which I so call to distinguish them from Rectifications) were perform'd in Retorts plac'd in Sand, (and not with a naked Fire) care being taken that the Vessels were not too much fill'd because Blood, N. B. if it be not well dry'd, is apt to swell much, and pass into the Neck of the Retort, if not into the Receiver.
Secondly, I desire to give notice, that the Blood we made use of, was drawn from Persons that parted with it out of custom, or for prevention, Page  97 which was the main reason why I was so scantly furnished with Blood, that of sound persons being in the place I resided in, very difficult to be procur'd in quantity, and that of sick persons being unfit for my pur∣pose.
Thirdly, It may not be amiss for obviating of some Scruples, to ad∣vertise that, there being so great a Cognation between the Spirit and Volatile Salt of Humane Blood, that, as we shall see anon, 'tis probable that the latter is little other than the Spirit in a dry form, and the former than the Salt united with Phlegm enough to give it a Liquid form; 'tis presum'd that it may be allow∣able to consider the Volatile Salt of Blood as its dry Spirit.
Lastly, To the three foregoing, 'twill be fit to add this Fourth Ad∣vertisement, That tho, in comparison of the Particulars thrown in to the Second and Third Part of those Me∣moirs, the ensuing Fourth Part is Page  98 methodically written, yet you are not to expect to find in the Method any thing of Accurateness; since the Experiments and Observations whereof this Fourth Part consists, were written in loose Papers, at di∣stant times and on differing occasions, and because of this and of my haste, will be found, without any regular dependence or connexion, referr'd to the Titles under which they are rang∣ed, in that order, or rather disorder, wherein they chanc'd to come to hand.

    • App. An Appendix containing Par∣ralipomena, and Promiscuous Ex∣periments, and Observations con∣cerningPage  102the Spirit of Humane Blood.
The I. (Secondary) Title. Whether Humane Blood may be so or∣der'd by Fermentation, or Putre∣faction, as that in Distillation a Spirit either Ʋrinous or Vinous, may ascend before the Phlegm.
IT is not unlike, that you will think the Question propos'd in this Title, more curious than neces∣sary; and I shall not quarrel with you if you do so. But that you may not think it groundless, I desire two things may be consider'd; first, how ordinary it is, especially since the Learned Dr. Willis's Writings came to be applauded, to look upon Fevers as inordinate Fermentations of the Blood. And the second, that tho Humane Urine, which has a great cognation with the Humane Blood, will not, whilst fresh, afford by Di∣stillation Page  103 a Spirit or Volatile Salt, till the Phlegm be first drawn off, and then requires a good Fire to make it rise; yet, if it be kept for a compe∣tent time (which usually amounts to divers weeks) in Fermentation, (as Chymists commonly call that, which in this case I would rather stile Pu∣trefaction) the Spirit and Volatile Salt will with a gentle Fire ascend, be∣fore much, if not before any Phlegm.
These two Considerations, as I was intimating, may keep that from being thought a groundless Question, which has been above propos'd. And, thô I more incline to the Ne∣gativethan to the Affirmative, at least as to the first part or member of the Question, yet I thought it well deserv'd to be determin'd, if it may be, by Experiment. But for want of a sufficient quantity of Blood, and good luck in making Tryals with that I could procure, I must suspend my Judgment, till further Experi∣ence resolve me one way or other. Page  104 By what I have yet try'd, I am not much encourag'd to expect from Humane Blood a Vinous or Ardent Spirit, thô that be the usual product of Fermentation in Liquors, and I am the less encourag'd to expect this, because I am not sure that there is any Fermentation truly & properly so call'd in Humane Blood, either within or out of the Body; having never yet found any thing in the Blood, or Urine, that convinc'd me, that either of those Liquors would afford an ardent Spirit. I remember I once kept Humane Blood for a year together, in a Glass very carefully, and if I mistake not, Hermetically clos'd, with a purpose to try, whe∣ther any Spirits would first ascend. But when the Blood came to be ex∣pos'd to the contact of the Air, the stink was so great and offensive, es∣pecially to some Ladies that liv'd in the house, that we were fain to have it hastily thrown away. Another time, having caus'd some Sheeps Page  105 Blood to be digested in a pretty large Vial Hermetically sealed, after it had continued a good while in the Digestive Furnace, upon a sudden, thô no Body touched it, it broke with a surprizing noise, and blew off the long neck of the Vial. Two or three almost like mischances I had with Attempts made on Hu∣mane Blood, which I was the more troubled at, because I thought it not very improbable, that by Putrefacti∣on the Texture of Blood, like that of Urine, may be so loosen'd or other∣wise alter'd, that a Volatile Salt or Spirit may in a slow distillation as∣cend before the Phlegm. But, as I said before, 'tis only from further Experi∣ence that I must expect Satisfaction in these Enquiries.
Yet in the mean time I shall add on this occasion, That the ill success I had in my Attempts to draw a Spirit from entire Portions of Blood, without separating any part from it, or adding any foreign Body to it, Page  106 did not hinder, but rather invite, me to try, whether I could not make some Experiment of affinity to those above mentioned upon whose success I might ground some kind of Con∣jecture, what would have been the Events of those Tryals, in case they had not miscarryed. Wherefore look∣ing upon the Serum of Blood as the likelyest part of it, as well as much more likely than the entire Blood, to concur to a Fermentation properly so call'd; we took some Ounces of this Serum, and put to it about a fourth part of Raisins (of the Sun) well bruis'd, and kept them in a Glass, whereof a considerable part was left empty, and having clos'd the Vessel, we kept it in a warm room for many days. The Event of this Tryal was, that within few days the Raisins began to emerge, and af∣terwards continued to float; and there was produc'd or extricated a considerable quantity of permanent and Springy Air, as by a certain Con∣trivance Page  107 described in another Paper, did manifestly appear. Both which Phaenomena seem'd plainly to argue, that there had been some degree of Fermentation produc'd in the mix∣ture. But yet when we came to distill the thus alter'd Serum, thô it did not stink, as if it had putrefied it would have done, yet the Liquor that first ascended, even with a gentle heat, did not tast or smell like a Vinous Spirit, thô it was differing from meer Phlegm. If I had been furnish∣ed with a greater quantity of Serum, perhaps the reiterated Experiment would have given more satisfaction; and in making it I would have been careful to observe, whether the pro∣duc'd Fermentation might not be suspected to proceed not so much from the whole Serum as such, as from the Aqueous Particles, in di∣stinction from the others that con∣cur'd with them to compose it.
As for the Second Question intima∣ted in this present First Title, name∣ly, Page  108 whether Blood will by Digestion or Putrefaction be so opened, as that when it is distill'd, the Spirit will as∣cend before the Phelgm: I likewise endeavour'd to try, That, with the Serous part of the Blood pour'd off from the Fibrous or Coagulated, as supposing it in this separated state, more proper for our Tryal than the en∣tire Blood: and having kept a pretty quantity of this Serum above four times as long, as I had observ'd to have been sufficient, to make Urine in Distilla∣tion part with its Spirit before its Phlegm; we distill'd this long kept Li∣quor with a very gentle sire, that few or none besides the fugitive parts might at first ascend. But we found the Liquor that came over, to have but little strength, either as to smell or Tast, nor would it readily turn Syrup of violets Green. I say readily, be∣cause after they had been some hours together it would. But yet as a Volatile Alcaly, it would presently turn a strong solution made of common Sub∣limate Page  109 in fair Water, into a White, Opacous, and almost Milky Liquor.
The II. (Secondary) Title, Whether Spirit of Humane Blood be really any thing but the Volatile Salt and Phlegm well commix'd?
SInce the Question mov'd in this Title may be also propounded concerning other Alcalisate Spirits, as those of Urine, Harts-horn, Soot, &c. It is upon that account the more im∣portant. And for this Reason, as well as for the difficulty of determining it by cogent Proofs, I may think my self oblig'd to forbear taking upon me to decide it peremptorily, till further Experience shall have furnish'd me with fuller Information. So that for the present about this difficult Question, I shall venture to say no more than this, that what has hitherto Page  110 occurr'd to me, inclines me to think that the Spirit of Humane Blood is totally compos'd of Volatile Salt and Phlegm, if by Phlegm, we under∣stand not Simple, or Elementary Water, but a Liquor, that, althô it pass among Chymists for Phlegm, and deserves that name better than any other Liquor afforded by Hu∣mane Blood, yet in the strictest acception it is not That; for when the Spirit, Volatile Salt, and Oil, are separated from it by Distil∣lation and Sublimation, as far as they are wont to be in Chymical Prepa∣rations of Volatile Alcalies, the re∣maining Liquor, which passes for Phlegm, will yet be impregnated with some Particles of Oyl, and per∣haps also with some few of volatile Salt, that are too minute to be distin∣guishable by the naked Eye. But whether frequent Rectifications may so accurately separate these Hetero∣geneous parts, as perfectly to free the Aqueous ones from them, and Page  111 thereby reduce the Phlegm to Simple or Elementary Water, I am content at least till I shall have had sufficient Quantities of distill'd Blood for mak∣ing the requisite Tryals, to leave as a Problem. And this the rather, be∣cause I am not sure, but that by fre∣quent Distillations, some Particles of the Fire may from time to time Substantially be associated with those of the Liquor; nor yet but that even in the first Distillation of Humane Blood, The Fire may have either se∣parated or produc'd a Liquor that though almost strengthless, and not justly referable to either of the re∣ceiv'd Principles or Ingredients, Oyl, Salt and Earth, is not yet Phlegm truly so call'd, but a Liquor as yet Anonymous; as I have elsewhere shewn, that Woods and many other Bodies afford by Distillation a Liquor that is not an Oyl, and is neither Acid nor Alcalisate, and yet is no true Phlegm, but as I have there sty∣led it, an Adiaphorous Spirit.
Page  112It will probably be thought Mate∣rial, if on this occasion I add, in fa∣vour of the Opinion or Conjecture to which I lately own'd my self in∣clin'd, That considering that the knowledge of the Composition of a Body may be sometimes as well, if not better, investigated by the way of generating or producing of it, as by that of Analysing or Resolving it; I made for Tryals sake the following Experiment. We dissolv'd in distilled Water as much Volatile Salt of Hu∣mane Blood as the Liquor would take up, and then having carefully distill'd it in a conveniently shap'd Vessel, with a regulated degree of Heat, the Distillation afforded us such a Liquor as was desir'd, namely one that by Smell, Tast and divers Operations, appear'd to be a good brisk Spirit of Humane Blood. This Experiment for the main, was made another time with the like suc∣cess.

The III (Secondary) Title. Of the Species of Saline Bodies to which the Spirit of Humane Blood is to be refer'd.
I need not spend much time to de∣clare a thing that is now so well known to many Physicians and Chy∣mists of this and some of the neigh∣bouring Countries, as 'tis that of late years Saline Spirits obtain'd by Distil∣lation have been observ'd to be of two sorts. But because there are ma∣ny, even of the Learned especially in the remoter parts of Europe, that are not well acquainted with this Distinction, lest some to whom you may shew this Paper should chance to be of that number, it may not be amiss to intimate in two or three Words, that the Saline Spirits that as∣cend Page  114 in Distillation, are some of them Acid in Tast, as Spirit of Nitre, Spirit of Vitriol, &c. And some others have Tasts very differing from that, being rather somewhat like Common Salt, or like Lixiviate Salts. And the dif∣ference is greater in their operations than in their Tasts; For being put together there will presently ensue a manifest Conflict between them, and usually (for I have not found it to hold in all cases) the one will Preci∣pitate the Bodies that the other hath Dissolved. And 'tis necessary to add, that among the Salts called Alcalies, some are Fixt in considerable degrees of Fire, and others not, for which reason divers modern Spagyrists and Physicians, that take Acid and Alcaly for the true Principlesof Mixt Bo∣dies, call the one Fixt and the other Volatile Alcalies. And, though I have elsewhere questioned this Doctrine, and given my Reasons why I approve neither it nor the Appellations newly mention'd, and often call the SaltsPage  115 made by Combustion, simply Alcalies or else Lixiviate Salts, and those that ascend sometimes Ʋrinous, and some∣times Volatile Salts and Spirits: yet, since the Names of Fixt Alcalies and Volatile ones are now much in request, I shall comply with custom, & often∣times (though not always) make use of them in the sense of those that employ them.
These things being premis'd I may now seasonably propound this impor∣tant Question, To what Species of Sa∣line Bodies the Spirit of Humane Blood is to be referr'd? I say of Saline Bo∣dies because though the Spirit of Blood be a Liquor, yet its more effi∣cacious Operations seem almost (if not more then almost) totally to depend upon the Fugitive Salt where∣with it abounds. The ground of the fore∣going Question may be twofold; the one, that I have elsewhere prov'd a∣gainst the general supposition, that some Volatile Salts, that arise even in a dry form, may not be of an Alcali∣sate; Page  116 but Acid nature, and the other, that not only Helmont and his Disci∣ples, but a great part of the Modern Chymists and Physicians too, ascribe Digestion to an Acid Ferment or Men∣struum in the Stomach; Whence one may suspect that store of Acid Corpus∣cles may pass into the Mass of Blood, & impregnate it, as I elsewhere shew that Particles of differing Natures may be even by the senses discovered to do.
But notwithstanding this, I shall not scruple to say in answer to the propounded Question, that, as far as I have hitherto been able to observe, the Spirit of Humane Blood is mani∣festly referable to that Classis that many call Volatile Alcalies (and I of∣ten call Ʋrinous Spirits) for I find Spirit of Blood capable of doing those things, the performance of which has been looked on almost ever since I pub∣lickly propos'd them, as the Touch∣stone to know Volatile Alcalies, and distinguish them from the other sorts of Saline Bodies. For the Spirit of Hu∣mane Page  117 Blood will make a great con∣flict with divers Acid Spirits, as Spirit of Salt, Aqua fortis, &c. It will immediately turn Syrup of Violets from its Blew Colour into a fair Green, 'twill Precipitate a Solution of Sublimate in common Water, into a White Powder, and in short I found it to perform those other things that may be expected from Volatile Al∣calies as such, as often as I had occa∣sion to make Tryal of it, some∣times on one Body, and sometimes on another.
If I were sure (as for Reasons else∣where declar'd I am not) that the Digestion of Aliments were made by an Acid Ferment or Juice, whence∣soever the Stomach is furnish'd with it, I should be prone to suspect that some Acid Particles may be mingled with the Blood. But however that would not hinder me from referring the Spirit of Humane Blood to Vo∣latile Alcalies, because so few Acid Particles would be either destroy'd Page  118 by the Alcalisate ones, that are so abundant in the Spirit, or at least these would be so very much pre∣dominant, as to allow us very war∣rantably to give on their account a Denomination to the Mixture. As if a few drops of Spirit of Vinegar were mix'd with some Pints or Pounds of stale Ʋrine, they would either be depriv'd of their Acidity by some Corpuscles of a contrary nature, that they would meet with in the Liquor, or they would be so obscur'd and overpower'd by the Fugitive Salts it abounds with, that the Acetous Corpuscles would not hinder the Spi∣rituous Liquor drawn from the Mix∣ture by distillation to be justly refe∣rable to the Classis of Volatile, Ʋrinous Salts.
Page  119
The IV. (Secondary) Title. Whether Spirit of Humane Blood be differing from Spirit of Ʋrine, and other Spirits that are call'd Vola∣tile Alcalies?
THe Question, Whether there be any difference be•ween the Spirit of Humane Blood, and other volatile Alcalies? As Spirit of Urine, Harts-horn, &c. seems to me very difficult to be decided, because two Bodies may agree in many Qua∣lities, and perhaps in all of those that are the most obvious, and yet may on some third Body, or in some Ca∣ses, manifest distinct Powers, and have their peculiar Operations. Nor do I yet see any certain way, by which the Affirmative part of the Question, thô it should be true, can be clearly demonstrated. Therefore Page  120 leaving the peremptory Decision of this Question, to those that shall think themselves qualify'd to make it, I shall (at least till I be further in∣form'd) content my self to make a Couple of Remarks, in reference to the propos'd Enquiry.
And first I think, there may be a great difference between Volatile Salts or Spirits, as they are ordinari∣ly prepar'd for medicinal uses, and as they may, by reiterated Rectifica∣tions, and otherways of Depuration, be brought to as great a simplicity or Purity, as a dextrous Chymist can bring them to: I thus express my self, because as to an Exquisite or Elementary Simplicity thô some eminent Artists pretend to it, I am not sure that Chymists can attain it; especially considering what I elsewhere shew of the unheeded Commix∣tures, that may (at least sometimes) be made by the Corpuscles of the Fire, with those of the Bodies it works on.
Page  121My other Remark is, that whether or no, if the Spirit of Humane Blood, and other Liquors abounding like it in Volatile Alcalies, were reduc'd to as great a purity as they can by Art be brought to, they would be altogether alike in their Nature and Qualities; yet, if we consider them (as men use to do) in that state wherein they are wont to be thought pure enough for medicinal uses, and are accordingly employ'd by Phy∣sicians and Chymists; I think it very probable, that there is some difference between the Spirit of Humane Blood and some other Volatile Alcalies, and particularly those afforded by Urine and by Harts-horn. For thô to me the bad smells of all these Liquors seem to be much alike, yet divers Ladies, and those of very differing Ages, affirm they find a manifest difference between these smells, and do abhor the odour of Spirit of Blood as a stink, though they will with pleasure hold their noses a great Page  122 while over the Sp. of Harts-horn, and even that of (vulgar or European) Sal-armoniac (which is in effect a Sp. of Mans Urine) and affirm themselves to be much refresh'd by it. And, whereas with Spirit of Urine or of Sal-armoniac joyn'd in a due proportion with Spi∣rit of Salt, I have usually (as I have long since noted in a∣nother Paper a) been able to make a Salt that shoots into the pe∣culiar Figure of Sal-Armoniac, which figure is very differing from that of Sea Salt, Nitre, &c. I have seldom, if ever obtain'd (at least in any quan∣tity) a Salt of that shape, by the commixture of the Spirit of Humane Blood, with that of common Salt; for, though their Saline Corpuscles, upon the Evaporation of the Super∣fluous moisture, would coagulate to∣gether, yet the concretion seem'd con∣fus'd, and either all or a great part of it was destitute of that neat and distinct shape, that I had several times Page  123 observ'd in concretions, made by the mixture of the Spirit of Sea-Salt with Urinous Spirits. And, as to the Medicinal vertues of Spirit of Blood, though I have not had opportunity to make comparisons experimentally, and therefore shall forbear to affirm any thing my self, yet, if we credit the famous Helmont, there is a con∣siderable difference between the Sp. of Humane Blood, & that of Humane Urine, since he somewhere expressly notes, (though I remember not the place, nor have his Book at hand) that the Spirit of Humane Blood cures Epilepsies, which is a thing the Spirit of Urine will not do.

The V. (Secondary) Title. Of the Quantity of Spirit contain'd in Humane Blood whether accompany'd with its Serum or dry'd.
'TIs not easy to determine the exact proportion of that Li∣quor, which, when by Distillation obtain'd from Humane Blood, the Chymists call its Spirit, in reference to the other Principles or Ingredi∣ents whereof the Blood consists. For some Mens Blood may be much more Phlegmatick or serous than that of others, which it self may be more or less Spirituous according to the Complexion, Age, Sex, &c. of the person that bleeds. But, to make some Estimate, that will not probably much recede from what may be ordinarily found, I shall in∣form you, that Twelve Ounces of Page  125 healthy Humane Blood afforded us seven Ounces and a half of Phlegm, and consequently about Four Ounces and a half of dry stuff. And then I shall add, that having committed to Distillation in a Retort in a Sand Fur∣nace seven Ounces of well dry'd (but not scorch'd) Blood, we ob∣tain'd about seven Drams, that is, about an Eighth part of Spirit, to which thô it were not rectified, that Name may well enough be given, because it was so very rich in Spiri∣tuous and Saline parts, that it left in the Receiver, and in the Vial I kept it in, a good deal of Volatile Salt undissolv'd, which a Phlegma∣tick Liquor would not have done. And if that be admitted for a truth, that was above propos'd as a very like∣ly Conjecture; namely, that Spirit of Blood is but Salt and Phlegm united, we may well suppose that Humane Blood yields a far greater proporti∣on of Spirit than this; since from the seven Ounces of dry'd Blood last Page  126 mentioned, we obtain'd about Five Drams of Volatile Salt, which if we had by Distillations united with a fit quantity of Phlegm, would pro∣bably have afforded us near Two Ounces more of a Liquor deserving the name of Spirit.
The VI. (Secondary) Title. Of the Consistence and Specifick Gra∣vity of the Spirit of Humane Blood.
TO the Consistence of the Spirit of Humane Blood, taken in the more laxe sense of the word Con∣sistence, one may refer its Specifick Gravity, (as that is usually propor∣tionate to the Density of Bodies,) the greater or lesser degree of Fluidity that belongs to the Liquor as a Mass, and the greater or lesser Subtilty of the Minute Parts whereof it is com∣pos'd, Page  127 or wherein it abounds.
And as to the first of the Three At∣tributes, we have noted to be referrable to the Consistence of our Spirit; Gra∣vity is a Quality that is so radicated, if I may so speak, in the nature of Vi∣sible Fluids or Liquors, and does so obstinately accompany them, that I durst not omit to examine the Spe∣cifick Gravity (that is, the Gravity in proportion to the Bulk) of Spirit of Humane Blood; though by reason of the small quantity I had of it, I could not make use of the same In∣struments, that I was wont to em∣ploy in Hydrostatical Tryals, where I was not so stinted in the Liquor to be examined. But however I made a shift to make a Tryal of this kind, by which I found, that a compact body weighing fifty eight Grains in the Air, and in Water six Grains and three fourth parts weighed in Recti∣fied Spirit of Humane Blood, but five Grains and one fourth part. And on this occasion I shall tell you, Page  128 what I presume, you did not expect, which is, that notwithstanding the Volatility of our Spirit of Blood, I found that a pretty large piece of Amber being put into it, did not, as most men would confidently expect, fall to the bottom of the Liquor, but kept itself floating at the upper part of it, and if plung'd into it would emerge.
The next Quality we refer'd to the Consistence of our Spirit of Blood, is the Degree of its Fluidity, or, if you please, its greater or lesser Im∣munity from Tenaciousness or Viscosity,which some Modern Philosophers (whose Opinion needs not here be discuss'd) think to belong to all Li∣quors as such. Now one may be the more inclin'd to expect a manifest Degree of Tenacity in the Spirit of Humane Blood, because among many Modern Chymists it passes for an Alcaly; and we know that divers other Alcalisate Liquors, as Oyl of Tartar per deliquium, Fix'd Nitre re∣solv'd Page  129 the same way, Solution of Pot-ashes, &c. are sensibly unctuous, and but languidly Fluid. But yet I did not observe, that some rectified Spi∣rit of Humane Blood, that I purpose∣ly try'd between my Fingers, did feel more unctuous than Common Wa∣ter. And whereas those that sell Brandy, or Spirit of Wine, are wont to shake it, till it afford some Froth, and then by the stay this makes on the Surface, to judge of the Tenacity or Tenuity of the Liquor, esteeming that to be the most Ʋnctuous, where∣on the Bubbles make the longest stay,and that the finest on which they soon∣est disappear; I thought fit by the same Method to examine Spirit of Humane Blood, and found that the Froth would last very little on the Surface of it, the bubbles breaking or vanishing, almost (if not quite) as nimbly, as if the Liquor had been good Spirit of Wine. And I likewise observ'd, that when I warily let fall some of our well rectify'd Spirit of Page  130 Blood upon some other body, it seemed to me, that the single drops were manifestly smaller than those of Water, and of several other Li∣quors, would have been, which will be much confirm'd by one passage of what I have to say about the third Quality referrable to the Consistence of the Spirit we treat of.
Because it may be a thing of some Importance, as well as Curiosity, to know how subtil the active parts of Spirit of Humane Blood are, and how disposed and fitted to disperse or dif∣fuse themselves through other Liquors of convenient Textures; to make a visible discovery of this, I bethought my self of a Method, that having formerly devised for several purposes, I thought fitly applicable to my pre∣sent Design. For having looked up∣on it as a great defect, that men have lazily contented themselves to say in general, that such a Body is of subtile, or of very subtile Parts, without trou∣bling themselves to find out any way Page  131 of making more particular and less indeterminate Estimates of that sub∣tilty; I was invited to find out and practise a way that might on divers oc∣casions somewhat supply that defect. But having delivered this easy method in another Paper, I shall forbear to repeat a tedious account of it in this; since it may here suffice to tell you in short, what will perhaps surprize you; namely, That according to the forementioned way, we so prepar'd Common Water by Infusions made in it without heat, that by putting one single drop of our rectified Spi∣rit of Humane Blood into ℥iv. + ℈iv. (which make 2000 grains) of the prepar'd Water, and lightly shaking the Vial, there appeared throughout the Liquor a manifest Colour, where∣of no degree at all was discernible in it just before. Which sufficiently argues a wonderful subtilty of Parts in the Spirit we employ'd; since that a single drop of it could disperse its Corpuscles, so as to diffuse it self Page  132 through, and mingle with two thou∣sand times as much Water, and yet retain so much Activity, as to make their presence not only sensible, but conspicuous, by a manifest change of Colour they produc'd. I confess this computation is made, upon sup∣position that a drop of Water weighs about a grain, and that a drop of our Spirit of Blood was of the same weight with a drop of Water.
The former supposition is com∣monly made; and though I have not found it to be exactly true, but that a drop of Water weigh'd a Tan∣tillum more than a Grain; yet that difference is much more than recom∣pens'd, by that which we found be∣tween the weight of a drop of Water, and the weight of one of Spirit of Humane Blood. For having in a very good and carefully adjusted Ballance, let fall ten drops of Com∣mon Water, and as many of our Rectified Spirit of Humane Blood, (as judging it a safer way to make Page  133 an Estimate, by comparing so ma∣ny drops of each Liquor than one alone;) we found, as we might well expect, that a drop of this last nam'd Liquor, as it was manifest∣ly lesser, so it was far lighter, than a drop of Water, in so much, that the whole ten drops did not a∣mount to four Grains. So that we may safely judge the drop of Spirit to have manifestly diffused it self, and acted upon above 4000 times so much Water in weight, (and per∣haps in bulk too) since indeed the pro∣portion extended a good way to∣wards that of one to 5000; and so may be said to be as that of one to between 4000 and 5000, which, tho it may seem incredible to those that are unacquainted with the great sub∣tilty of Nature and Art, in the Com∣minutions they can make of Bodies; yet I can by repeating the Experi∣ment easily convince a doubter, in less than a quarter of an hour. And this Subtilty of the Parts of Blood Page  134 will appear yet greater, if it be con∣sider'd, (what I think I can evince,) that no contemptible part of the single drop I employ'd was Phlegm, useless to the change produc'd, the operation being due to the Energy of the Saline Spirits of the little drop.
The VII. (Secondary) Title. Of the Odour, Taste, Colour, and Transparence of the Spirit of Hu∣mane Blood.
THose Qualities, that in my Opinion more generally than deservedly are call'd first, do not any of them belong to the Spirit of Hu∣mane Blood, in such manner as to oblige me to say any thing of them in relation to it. And therefore I shall content my self to have made this transient mention of them, to keep it Page  135 from being thought, that through forgetfulness I had overlook'd them. Yet something there is, that may not inconveniently be refer'd to the heat or coldness of Spirit of Humane Blood; in regard that Physicians, as well as Philosophers, distinguish these Qualities into Actual and Potential. For it seems, that the Spirit of Hu∣mane Blood is in reference to some Liquors potentially cold, since it refri∣gerates them, and in reference to some others potentially hot, since being mingled with them, the mixture be∣comes actually hot. Of this last I shall here set down the ensuing In∣stance.
Into a slender Cylindrical Glass we put the lower part of an Herme∣tically Seal'd Thermoscope, which in this Paper and elsewhere I usually call the gag'd one, because it was adjust∣ed according to the standard of such Instruments kept at Gresham Col∣ledge. Into this Cylindrical Glass we pour'd as much moderately Page  136 strong Spirit of Blood, as would co∣ver the Ball of the Thermometer, and then drop'd on that Liquor some good Spirit of Salt, upon whose mingling with it there was produc'd a Conflict accompany'd with noise and bubbles, and a heat, which nimbly enough made the Spirit of Wine ascend above two inches and a half. This Experiment is therefore the more considerable, because there are divers Volatile Alcalies that being confounded with Acid Spirits, tho they seem to make a true Effervescence, yet do really produce a notable de∣gree of Coldness. And that which to me seem'd considerable on this oc∣casion, was, that whereas I had several times found by Tryal, that the Spi∣rit of Verdegrease (which some call the Spirit of Venus) would with the Volatile Salt of Sal Armoniack, or of Urine, produce a seeming Effer∣vescence, but a real coldness; this Spi∣rit of Verdegrease it self, being mix'd in the forementioned small Cylin∣drical Page  137 Glass, with but moderately strong Spirit of Blood, did not only produce a hissing noise and store of bubbles, but an actual heat, where∣by the Spirit of Wine in the Ther∣moscope was made quickly to ascend above an inch and a half, tho the Liquors employ'd amounted not both together to two spoonfuls.
The VIII. (Secundary) Title. Of the Dissolutive Power of Spirit of Humane Blood.
IT will not only serve to mani∣fest the Subtilty and Penetran∣cy of the Spirit of Human Blood, but it may be also of some use to Physicians, if it be made appear by Experiments, that this Spirit is by itself not only a good Medicine for several diseases, (as will be hereafter shewn,) but may be also employ'd Page  138 as a Menstruum, to dissolve several Bo∣dies, and even some Metalline ones. And because these last mention'd are the most unlikely to be readily dis∣soluble, by a substance belonging to the Animal Kingdom, as Chymists speak; I shall subjoyn two Tryals, that I made to evince this Dissolu∣tive Power of the Spirit of Blood.
And first we took Crude Copper in Filings, (which if they be very small, are so much the fitter for our purpose) and having pour'd on them some highly rectify'd Spirit of Human Blood, we shook them to∣gether, and in about a quarter of an hour or less, perceiv'd the Menstru∣um to begin to look a little Blewish, which argu'd its operation to have already begun. And this colour grew higher and higher, till after some hours the Menstruum had dis∣solved Copper enough to make it deeply Ceruleous. Some other, and somewhat differing Tryals on the same Metal will be met with in their Page  139 proper place. In the mean time I shall here take notice, that in some Circumstances the Spirit of Blood has such an operation upon Copper, whose quickness is surprising. For having made a coin'd piece of that Metal clean and bright (that no grease or foulness might hinder the effect of the Liquor,) and put a drop or two of our Spirit upon it, with∣in about half a Minute of an Hour, (observ'd by a watch that shew'd Seconds) the verge of the moistned part of the Surface appear'd blewish, and almost presently after, the rest of the wetted part acquir'd a fine A∣zure Colour.
We also took filings of Zink, or (as in the shops they call it) Spelter, and having pour'd on them very well rectified Spirit of Blood, we ob∣serv'd, that even in the cold it quick∣ly began to work manifestly, thô not vigorously. But being assisted with a little heat, it dissolv'd the Zink briskly, and not without producing Page  140 store of bubbles, being also a little discolour'd by the operation of this Experiment, some use is made in a∣nother place, and therefore need not be deliver'd in this.
On this occasion I shall add, that for curiosities sake I took a piece of Coagulated Blood, but not dry'd, somewhat bigger than a large Pea, having a care to take it from the lower part of the lump of Blood, that it might be black, the superfi∣cial part of Fibrous Blood that lies next the Air, being usually Red. This clot of Blood we put into a slender Vial of clear Glass, that the colour might be the better discern'd, and then pour'd on it a little Recti∣fied Spirit of Humane Blood, and shook the Glass alittle; where∣upon in a trice the colour of (at least) the Superficial part of the Blood, was, as I had conjectur'd, manifestly chang'd, the blackness quite disap∣pearing, and being succeeded by a Page  141 very florid colour like that of fine Scarlet. The Liquor also was ting'd, but not with near so deep or so fair a Red, and by the little bubbles that from time to time past out of the Clod into it, it seem'd to work somewhat like a Menstruum. And yet soon after coming to look upon this lump of Blood again, I found it to have much degenerated from its former colour, to one less fair and more dark.
We took also another Clot of Blood like the former, save that one part of it which had lain next the Air, was not black; and having in a Vial like the former pour'd on it some Spirit of Blood, taken out of the same Vial whence I took the first parcel, the Reddish colour seem'd presently to be much improv'd, and made more fair, and like true Scar∣let. But the black was not so al∣ter'd, as to be depriv'd of its black∣ness, but retain'd a dark and dirty colour. So that this second Expe∣riment Page  142 requires a further Tryal, when there shall be conveniency to make it, and it will the rather de∣serve one, because what has been already recited of the Operation of the Spirit upon the two parcels of Blood, may suggest uncommon Re∣flections to Speculative Wits.
And here on this occasion it will be proper to relate to you, that having a confus'd remembrance, that I had a great while before put up some Humane Blood, with a certain quan∣tity of Volatile Spirit, to keep it fluid and preserve it, without distinctly remembring what Volatile Alca∣ly I had employ'd; I found among other Glasses that had been laid a∣side, one Bolt-head with a long Neck, to which was ty'd a Label, importing that at such a time twelve Drams of Humane Blood, were put up with two Drams of Spirit of Hu∣mane Blood. By the date of this Paper it appear'd, that this Blood had been preserv'd much above a Page  143 whole twelve Month; and yet it ap∣pear'd through the Glass of a fine Florid Colour, and seem'd to be little less than totally Fluid. And indeed when we came to open the Vessel, which was carefully stopt with a good Cork, and hard Seal∣ing Wax, we found no ill scent or other sign of Putrefaction in the Mixture, and but a very small Por∣tion of Blood lightly clotted at the bottom; the rest passing readily through a Rag. So that the Spirit of Humane Blood seems to have a great embalming Vertue; since 'twas able so long and well to preserve six times its weight, of a Body so apt to Concrete and Putrefie, as Humane Blood is known to be, and probably would have preserv'd it much longer, if we had thought fit to prosecute the Experiment. To this account of our Trial I know not whether it will be worth while to add, that having broken it off, that we might distill the above mentioned Mixture with a Page  144 very gentle heat, the first Liquor that ascended was not a Spirit, but a kind of Phlegm, thô afterwards there came up, besides a Spirituous Liquor, a Volatile Salt in a dry form.
On this occasion I shall subjoyn the following Tryal, long since made with a Spirit, that I supposed to have been weaker than that, with which the lately mentioned Experiments were made.
In order to a design that need not here be mentioned, I caus'd some Filings of Mars to be purposely made, that being presently employ'd they might not contract any Rust, where∣by the operation of our Liquor might be made doubtful. On these we poured some of our Spirit, and having kept them together a while in Digestion, we found as we ex∣pected, that the Liquor had wrought on the Metal, and produc'd a con∣siderable quantity of a light sub∣stance, in colour almost like Crocus,Page  145 but something paler. And we also found more than we expected; for there appeared in the Liquor good store of thin Plates, like a kind of Terra Foliata, (as the Chymists speak) which after a very slight agitation, being held against the Sunbeams, exhibited the Colours of the Rain-bow in so vivid a manner, as did not a little delight, as well as surprize the Spectators, but I did not perceive that the tast of the Liquor was considerably Mar∣tial.

The IX. (Secondary) Title. Of the Tinctures that may be drawn with Spirit of Humane Blood.
MOst of those Extractions the Chymists call Tinctures, be∣ing, as I have elsewhere shewn, partial Solutions of the Bodies from which they are obtain'd, 'twill I pre∣sume be easily granted, that since the Spirit of Blood is able (as in the foregoing Title it has appear'd to be) to dissolve Copper and Zink, that are Solid and Metalline Bodies, 'twill be able to extract Tinctures out of di∣vers others. But, that this power of our Menstruum may be rather prov'd than supposed, it will not be amiss to add a few Instances of it.
Spirit of Blood being put upon English Saffron, did soon acquire up∣on it a fine Yellow Colour.
Page  147Spirit of Blood being put upon Powder'd Curcuma, or, as Trades∣men are wont to call it, Turmerick, did in the cold Extract from it a lovely Tincture, like a rich solution of Gold; which probably (to inti∣mate that upon the by) may prove a good de-obstruent Medicine, particu∣larly in the Jaundise; in which dis∣ease Turmerick that is taken to be a kind of East Indian Saffron, is upon experience commended, and in this our Tincture is united with Spirit of Humane Blood, which is very near of kin to Spirit of Urine, and probably at least as efficacious; with which Liquor, when well rectify'd, I have had more than ordinary success in the Jaundise.
To make some Trial of the Ex∣tracting Power of the Spirit of Blood, upon substances that have be∣long'd to Animals, I thought it might particularly conduce to some Medical purposes, to try what it would do upon the solid part of Hu∣mane Page  148 Blood it self slowly dry'd, so as not to be burn'd, but only to be reducible with some pains to fine Powder. Accordingly upon this well sifted Powder of Blood, we put some moderately strong Spirit of the same subject, on which the Li∣quor began very soon to colour it self, even in the cold; and within no long time after, it appear'd as Red as ordinary French Claret Wine. This Extraction made me suspect, that the Phlegm that was not carefully separated from the Spirit I then em∣ploy'd, might hasten the coloration of the Menstruum. For which reason I put upon another Portion of the same Powder some rectify'd Spirit of Blood, so well deflegmed that it would not dissolve a grain of the Vo∣latile Salt of Blood: And I found in∣deed, as I suspected, that this Men∣struum did not any thing near so soon draw a Tincture, as the other had done; for after divers hours the co∣lour it had obtain'd was but brown, Page  149 but after some hours longer the co∣lour appear'd to be heightned into Redness, but yet manifestly inferiour to that of the somewhat Phlegma∣tick Spirit above mentioned, where∣to it did yet in a longer time grow almost equal. By this means we may not only disguise the Spirit of Blood, but impregnate it with the finer parts of the unanalys'd solid Bo∣dy, which may possibly make the Spirit a Remedy more proper for some Diseases or Constitutions: and this Medicine I sometimes call the entire Tincture of Humane Blood, because it consists of nothing else but such Blood.
To shew at length that the Spirit of Humane Blood may extract Tinctures out of some of the hardest Bodies, I made the following Expe∣riment.
We took some choice Filings of Steel (for such are those that are saved by the Needlemakers) and ha∣ving put them into a small Egg, we Page  150 pour'd on them some highly rectify'd Spirit of Blood, and kept them all Night in digestion in a moderate heat. The next day (but not early) we found the Menstruum turn'd of a Brownish Red colour, that was deep enough. And some of the Filings that chanc'd to stick to the sides of the Glass, but were higher than the Liquor could reach in its gross body, seem'd to have been, either by Ex∣halations from the Menstruum, or perhaps by the Transient Contact of it, as it was pouring in, turn'd into a kind of Yellow Crocus Martis. I must not here forget, that having kept the Menstruum and the Filings together in the forementioned Egg for some days longer, the colour was grown opacous, and appear'd to be black, when it was look'd on in any considerable bulk, this last ex∣pression I employ, because it had a∣nother appearance, when it was somewhat thinly spread upon White Paper.
Page  151Perhaps it may be a Remark not altogether useless to Physicians, a∣mong many of whom Chaly beate Remedies are in very great request, if I add, that for reasons not needful to be mentioned here, having a suspi∣cion that our Spirit would work up∣on Steel, in another manner than the Acid Solvents wont to be used by Chymists and Physicians, we pour'd some of our Tincture drawn from Filings of Steel, upon a freshly drawn Tincture of Galls (infus'd in Common Water,) and did not find that this Liquor would with the In∣fusion make any Inky mixture, nor that the Precipitate that was quick∣ly produc'd, was of a black, much less of a true Inky colour: Though I have found means to produce in a trice a black mixture, with other Martial Solutions and Tinctures, which for curiosities sake I some∣times made Green, sometimes Red, sometimes Yellow, and sometimes, if I mistake not, of neither of those colours.
Page  152I have been the more express in setting down the Particulars above delivered, because I hope they may be somewhat helpful to Rectify the Judgment of divers very ingenious modern Physicians, especially among the Cultivaters of Chymistry, who build much upon a supposition, which though I deny not to be spe∣cious, I doubt is not solid, and I fear may be of ill consequence. For by the above recited Tryals it may ap∣pear, that 'tis unsafe either to sup∣pose, that if Chalybeates be dissolv'd in the body, it must be by some A∣cid Juice; or to conclude, that if Steel be dissolv'd by the Liquors of the Body, it must be ex praedominio, (as they speak) Alcalisate; since a Liquor that exercises a great Hosti∣lity against Acids, dissolves it; and by parity of reason one may pro∣bably infer the quite contrary of what they suppose; in regard that Steel in our Experiment was (parti∣ally at least) dissolv'd by what they Page  153 call an Alcaly; and consequently ought to be ex praedominio, of an A∣cid nature. But of this Hypothesis we elsewhere purposely discourse, and therefore shall here add nothing concerning it, but leave it to be consider'd, whether it would not be requisite to seek out some other way, than Physicians have hitherto pitch'd on, to explicate the manner of ope∣ration of Chalybeate Medicines in the Humane Body; and whether some use may not be made in Me∣dicine, of Martial Remedies prepar'd by Volatile Alcalies, instead of A∣cids.
I put some Spirit of Humane Blood upon powder'd Amber, sifted through a fine Sieve, and kept it in Digestion for some days, giving it a pretty degree of heat; but we ob∣tain'd not hereby any Tincture at all considerable; whether it was, that the Spirit was not yet highly enough rectify'd, or that the Amber (which was of a finer sort of white Amber) Page  154 was not so proper to yield its Tin∣cture, as I have several times found courser, but deeper colour'd Amber to be.
To this (IX.) Title may be refer'd the event that followed, upon our having put some Spirit of Humane Blood upon that sort of Gum-Laccae, that comes out of the East Indies in Grains, and (for that reason) is com∣monly call'd Seed-Lac. For the Spirit we put upon this, tho this be a resinous Gum, and of no easy So∣lution, soon became tincted; which I expected it should, because I con∣jectur'd that the Redness wont to appear in many of the Seed-like Grains, is but superficial, and pro∣ceeds from some adhering Blood of the little (winged) Insects, that by their bitings occasion the production of this Gum, upon the Twigs of the Tree where the Lac is found; on which Twigs I have more than once seen store of these Gummous Grains. So that the Tincture seems not to Page  155 be drawn from the Lac it self, but rather to be afforded by the Blood of these little Animals, which the Spirit of Humane Blood, that will draw Tinctures from dry'd Mans Blood, dissolves; and this Tincture may probably be a good Medicine, since most of the In∣sects us'd in Physick, as Millepedes, Lice, Bees, Aunts, &c. Even in our colder Climates, afford Medi∣cines of very subtle and pierce∣ing parts, and of considerable effi∣cacy.

The X. (Secondary) Title. Of the coagulating Power of the Spi∣rit of Humane Blood.
THough the Spirit of Humane Blood, have such a dissolving power as we have mention'd, in re∣ference to some Bodies, yet upon some others it seems to have a quite contrary Operation. I say seems, be∣cause it may be question'd, (and I am not now minded to dispute it) whether the effect I am going to speak of be a Coagulation, properly so call'd, that one Body makes of ano∣ther or a Coalition of Particles fitted, when they chance to meet one ano∣ther, (in a convenient manner,) to stick together. But whatever name ought to be properly given to the thing I am about to speak of, I have found by Tryal purposely made, that Page  157 the highly rectifyed Spirit of Hu∣mane Blood, being well mingled by shaking with a convenient quantity, (which should be at least equal) of Vinous Spirits that will burn all a∣way, (for if either of the Liquors be Phlegmatick, the Experiment suc∣ceeds either not at all, or not so well) there will presently ensue a Coagu∣lation or concretion, either of the whole Mixture, or a great portion of it, into Corpuscles of a Saline form, that cohering loosly together, make up a Mass that has consistence enough not to be fluid, though it be very soft: and in this form it may re∣main as far as I have yet tryed, for a good while, perhaps several weeks, or months at least, if it be kept in a cool place.
Page  158
The XI. (Secondary) Title. Of the Precipitating Power of Spirit of Humane Blood.
OF the Precipitating Power of Spirit of Humane Blood, I have yet observ'd nothing that is pe∣culiar, and therefore it may suffice to say in general, that, as far as I have had occasion to try, it has in common with those other Volatile Spirits, which I elsewhere call Ʋrinous, a Po∣wer of Precipitating most Bodies that are dissolv'd in Acid Menstruums I say most, because (as I have else∣where more fully shewn) it is an Er∣ror, though a vulgar one, to suppose (as Chymists and Physicians are wont to do) that whatever is dissolv'd by an Acid will be Precipitated by an Alcali as such, whether Fixt or Volatile, which latter sort they take Page  159 the spirits of Urine, Blood, &c. to be of. For there is no Necessity this Rule should hold, when the Body is of such a nature, that it may be dissolv'd as well by an Alcaly as by an Acid. And though, the Hy∣pothesis of Alcali and Acidum allow∣ed them not to think there were any such Bodies, yet I have in ano∣ther Paper Experimentally evinc'd, that there are so. And it may be prov'd without going very far, since we lately observ'd a that good Spirit of Humane Blood Would in the cold dissolve both Cop∣per & Zink, which are Bodies that will each of them be readily dissolv'd by Aqua fortis, and some other Acid Men∣struums.
Bating such Bodies as those I have been speaking of, I have not found but that Spirit of Humane Blood Pre∣cipitates other Bodies dissolv'd in Acid Menstruums, much after the Page  160 same manner that Spirit of Urine and other such Volatile Alcalies are wont to do. Of this, among other Instances, I remember that I made Tryal upon Red-lead or Minium dis∣solv'd in the Acid Salt of Vinegar, Silver in Aqua fortis, Gold in Aqua Re∣gia, and Tin dissolv'd in an appropri∣ated Menstruum. I also with our Spirit Precipitated the Solutions of divers other Bodies, which need not here be nam'd. But in regard of the great and frequent use that men make of Sea Salt, in preserving and seasoning what they eat, it may not be amiss particularly to mention that out of a solution of common Salt made in common Water, we could readily Precipitate with the Spirit of Blood, a substance that looked like a White Earth; and such a sub∣stance I obtain'd in far greater quantity, from that which the Salt∣makers call Bittern, which usually remains in their Salt pans after they have taken out as much, or near as Page  161 much Salt, as would Coagulate in figured grains.
The Spirit of Humane Blood does also make a Precipitation of Dantsick Vitriol dissolv'd in Water, but not, that I have observ'd, a total one, which you need not wonder at, because it will dissolve Copper, which is one of the Ingredients of Blew Vitriol.
The XII. (secondary) Title. Of the Affinity between Spirit of Hu∣mane Blood and some Chymical Oyls and Vinous Spirits.
THough in another Paper a I de∣clare my self, for Rea∣sons there express'd, dissatisfy'd with the Vulgar Notions of Sympathy, Antipathy, Friendship, Affinity, Hostility, &c. that are pre∣sum'd Page  162 to be found among Inanimate Bodies, yet in this place nothing forbids to employ the Terms Affinity Cognation, and Hostility, in the laxe and popular sense, wherein they are us'd not only by the Vulgar, but by School Philosophers and Chy∣mists.
It seems then, according to this acception of the Word Affinity, that there is such a thing between Recti∣fyed Spirit of Humane Blood, and pure Spirit of Wine; since we have formerly (under the Tenth Title) observ'd, that being put together they will readily Concoagulate, and continue united a long time. It is very probable, that the like Associa∣tionmay be also made with other Ardent Spirits prepar'd by Fermen∣tation.
We have likewise formerly noted, that our Spirit will make a Solution of the finer parts of Humane Blood well dry'd, which Instance I men∣tion on this occasion, because it seems Page  163 to be the Effect of some Affinity or Cognation (as most men would call, what I would call Mechanical Congrui∣ty) between the Spirit and the Body it works on, in regard I found, by more than one Tryal purposely made, that a highly Rectifyed Vinous Spirit (for if it be Phlegmatick, the Water may dissolve some of the Blood) would not (at least in divers hours that my Tryals lasted) draw any Tincture from it.
With Lixiviate Liquors, such as are made of Salt of Tartar, fix'd Nitre, &c. resolv'd in the Air or otherwise, the Chymist will expect that the Spirit of Blood should have an Affinity, since they esteem all these Liquors Alcalies though this be Vo∣latile and those be fix'd. But though these Liquors comport well with one another, yet we find not that they strictly Associate by Concoagulation, as we lately observ'd the Spirit of Blood to do with Spirit of Wine.
Page  164*The same Spirit of Blood mingles readily with that Spirit of Vege∣tables, that I have else∣where given a large account of under the Title of Adiaphorous Spirit, which argues that there is some Affinity between them, or rather, that there is not any manifest Hostility or con∣trariety.
The like Relation may be found between Spirit of Blood and many other Liquors, which it were need∣less and tedious to enumerate. It may better deserve the consideration of a Chymist, that though there is mani∣festly a near Cognation between the Spirit of Humane Blood and the Oyl, since they both proceed immediate∣ly from the same Body, yet even de∣phlegm'd Spirit of Blood being sha∣ken, and thereby confounded with its Oyl, will quickly separate again from it, though with Spirit of Wine (which is according to the Chymists a Liquid Sulphur as well as the Oyl) Page  165 it will permanently unite, notwith∣standing that these two Liquors do (to speak in their Language) belong even to differing Kingdoms, the one to the Animal, and the other to the Vegetable.
With the Essential Oyls (as Chy∣mists call them) of Aromatick Ve∣getables, or at least with some of them the well Rectifyed Spirit of H. Blood seems to have a greater Affinity. For having taken a dram of this Liquor, and an equal weight of Oyl of Anise-seeds drawn in a Lembick [per vesi∣cam,] and shaken them well together they made a soft or semifluid White Coagulum, that continu'd in that form for a day or two, and probably would have longer done so, if I had not had occasion to proceed further with it.
It may not be impertinent on this occasion to take notice, that because I presum'd, that, though Spirit of Blood would not totally mix with Essential Oyls, (as Chymists call Page  166 them) it might either communicate some Saline parts to them, or work a change in them; I digested a while in a Glass with a long neck, some Rectifyed Spirit of Humane Blood, with a convenient quantity of Oyl of Anise-seeds drawn in a Lembick, and found, as I expected, that the Oyl grew colour'd of a high Yellow, and afterwards attain'd to a Redness; which Experiment I the rather mention, be∣cause it may possibly afford you a hint about the Cause, of some Changes of Colour, that are pro∣duc'd in some of the Liquors of the Body.
Upon the foremention'd Affinity or congruity of the Spirit of Blood with that of Wine, and with (some) Essential Oyls, I founded a way of taking off the offensive smell of Spi∣rit of Humane Blood, which is the only thing that is likely to keep the more delicate sort of Patients from employing so useful a Medicine, as this will hereafter appear to be. Page  167 But to deal with a Philosophical can∣dor, I must not conceal from you, that, till Experience shall be duly con∣sulted, I shall retain a Doubt, whe∣ther the way employ'd to deprive our Spirit of its stink, will not also deprive it of part of its Efficacy. But on the other side, I consider it as a thing probable enough, that these Aromatis'd Spirits may, by being impregnated with many of the finer parts of the Oyls employ'd to correct their Odour, be likewise endow'd with the vertues of those Oyls, which are Liquors that Chymists not improbably believe to consist of the noblest parts of the Vegetables that afford them.
To Aromatise the Spirit of Hu∣mane Blood we employ'd two differ∣ing ways, the first whereof was this; we took a convenient quantity of well Rectifyed Spirit of Blood and having put it into a Glass Egg, we added to it as much, or (what may in many Cases more than suffice) Page  168 half as much, Essential Oyl of Anise-seeds for instance; And having shaken these Liquors together to mingle them very well, we plac'd the Glass in a sit posture, in a Fur∣nace where it should not have too great a heat, by which means the slight Texture of the Coagulum being dissolv'd, part of the Oyl (sometimes a great portion of it) appear'd by it self floating at the top of the Spirit. Whence being separated by a Tun∣nel or otherwise, the remaining Li∣quor was Whitish and without any stink, the smell predominant in it be∣ing that of the Anise-seeds, of which it tasted strongly, though the Sa∣line Spirituous parts of the Blood did in this Liquor retain a not inconside∣rable degree of their brisk and pene∣trant Tast.
The other way I thought of to Aromatise our Spirit of Blood, was by employing a Medium to unite it with Essential Oyls. For which purpose in a Vinous Spirit, so De∣phlegm'd Page  169 that in a Silver spoon it would totally burn away, we dis∣solv'd by shaking a convenient proportion, as an eighth part or a far less (according to the strength of the Oyl) of an Essential Oyl (of Anise-seeds for instance,) and to this solu∣tion we added an equal quantity, or some other convenient one, of our Rectifyed Spirit of Blood, and hav∣ing by shaking mix'd them as well as we could, we suffer'd the expected Coagulum (which was soft and not uniform) to rest for some time, after which it appear'd that some of the Oyl was reviv'd, and swam in drops distinct from the other Liquor, which consisted of a Mixture of the two Spi∣rits, impregnated with the Particles of the Oyl they had intercepted and de∣tain'd. This Liquor abounded with lit∣tle concretions made by the concoagu∣lation of the Sanguineous and Vinous Spirits. And these with a very gentle heat sublim'd in the form of a Volatile Salt, to the upper part of the Glass; Page  170 Which Salt seem'd to have a much less penetrating odour, then the meer Volatile Salt of Humane Blood, but had quite lost its stink, and yet re∣tain'd a considerable Quickness, and somewhat of the scent of the Anise Seeds; the remaining Liquor also was depriv'd of its ill smell, and mode∣rately imbued with that of the Oyl.
I thought it worth trying, whe∣ther there would be any Affinity between our Spirit (which I per∣ceiv'd contain'd in it many latent Particles of an Oleaginous nature) and the highly rectifyed Oyl of Pe∣troleum; which is a Mineral Bitumen: and having shaken together a Con∣venient quantity of these two Li∣quors in a new Vial, they presently turn'd into a White Mixture. And tho after it had for many hours been left to settle, the greater part of the Oyl swam above the Spirit, yet there appear'd betwixt the two Liquors a good quantity of a whitish Matter, which seem'd to Page  171 be something that had been produc'd by the Precipitation or Union of many Particles of the Spirit and Oyl, that were more dispos'd than the rest to combine with one another.
The XIII. (Secondary) Title. Of the Relation between Spirit of Humane Blood and the Air.
THat the Contact of the Air has a speedy and a manifest opera∣tion upon Humane Blood, is else∣where shewn by some Experiments of an Italian Virtuoso, Signior — and some of mine. But whether, after Humane Blood has had its Texture so much alter'd, as it uses to be by Distillation, it will retain any pecu∣liar Relation to the Air, I have not been able to make Tryals enough to determine; but however it will not be amiss, to set down the chief Ex∣periments I made on this occasion, because they may be considerable as parts of our History, tho they should not be so, as Arguments decisive of our controversy.
Page  172The first Experiment was quick∣ly made, by thinly spreading upon a piece of White Paper, (which ought to be close, that it may not soak up the Liquor) some small Fi∣lings of Copper, and wetting them well, without covering them quite over, with a few drops of good Spi∣rit of Blood, for by this means being very much expos'd to the free Air, the Action of the Liquor was so much promoted, that within a Mi∣nute or two it did, even in the cold, begin to acquire a blewish colour, and in fewer Minutes than one would have expected, that colour was so heightened as to become Ce∣ruleous. But when I put another parcel of the same Filings into a Vial, and cover'd them with Spirit of Blood, and then stopt the Vial, to keep it from intercourse with the external Air, the Liquor would not in some Hours acquire so deep a colour.
The other Experiment we made, in order to the lately propos'd en∣quiry, Page  173 was the same for substance, that I had formerly made, (and have elsewhere at large deliver'd) with the Spirit of Urine, and with that of Sal-Armoniac, save that, to spare our Spirit of Blood, we em∣ploy'd a far less quantity of it, then we did of either of the forementi∣on'd Liquors. For having in a clear Cylindrical Vial of about an Inch Diameter, put more Filings of Cop∣per than were requisite to cover the bottom, we pour'd upon it, but so much Spirit of Humane Blood, as serv'd to swim a Fingers breadth, or about an Inch above them. This Liquor, because of the quantity of Air, that was contain'd in the Vial, did within few Hours acquire a rich Blew colour, and this after a day or two began to grow more faint, and continued to do so more and more, till it came to be almost lost; but yet the Liquor was not altogether Lympid, or colourless, as I have often had it with Spirit of Urine, or Page  174 of Sal-Armoniac; which remains of blewishness I was apt to attribute to the great quantity of Air, that was included in the Vial with so small a quantity of Liquor. And tho I thought it not impossible, but that length of time might destroy these Remains of blewishness also, yet not having leisure to wait so long, I un∣stopt the Vial, and perceiv'd, as I expected, that in a very short time, perhaps about two Minutes of an hour, the Surface of the Liquor, where it was touch'd by the newly enter'd Air, became Ceruleous, and in a short time after, perhaps less than a quarter of an hour, the whole Body of the Liquor had attain'd a deeper colour than that of the Sky, which colour, the Vial being seasonably and carefully stop't, began in two or three days to grow paler again.
These Experiments would, I questi∣on not, to many seem manifestly to infer a great Cognation or Affinity (for I know not well what name to Page  175 give it) between the Spirit of Hu∣mane Blood and the Air. But tho I shall not deny the Conclusion as 'tis an Assertion, I dare not rely on the validity of the Inference; because I have for curiosities sake made the like Experiments succeed, with other Spirits abounding with Volatile Salt. I foresee it may very speciously be pretended, that those Tryals succeed∣ed upon the account of some Spiritu∣ous parts of the Blood, since Spirit of Urine is made of a Liquor separated from the Blood; and that, tho the Sal-Armoniack that is made in the East, may consist in great part of Camels Urine, yet that which is made in Europe, (where Camels are rarities) and is commonly sold in our Shops, is made of Mans Urine, and consequently its Spirit may well be presum'd to be impregnated with Spirit of Humane Blood. And I confess, that when this considerati∣on came first into my mind, it ap∣pear'd so probable, that I should Page  176 perhaps have acquiesced in it, if it were not for what I am going to subjoyn; namely, That I found by Tryal carefully made, that with ano∣ther Volatile Spirit made without any substance that is afforded by the body of Man, I could with Filings of Copper make an Experiment, ve∣ry analogous to that above related. But because in this Tryal, the reite∣rated contact of the Air produc'd in the Liquor not a Ceruleous, but a Green colour, I am willing to su∣spend my Judgment about the Pro∣blem lately propos'd, till experience shall have further inform'd me.
I know not whether it will be worth while to relate, that having in an unstopt Glass, put some Spirit of Humane Blood into a Receiver, plac'd upon our Pneumatick Engine, and withdrawn the incumbent Air by pumping; the Spirit of Blood seem'd to afford lesser and fewer Ae∣real Bubbles, than such a quantity of Common Water it self would pro∣bably Page  177 have done. But, as I lately intimated, I know not whether this observation be considerable, because being not willing to weaken by ex∣posing it, a fresh parcel of Spirit, I know not whether the paucity of Air observ'd in that lately mentio∣ned, were accidental or not.
The XIV. (Secondary) Title. Of the Hostility of the Spirit of Hu∣mane Blood to Acids, whether they be in the form of Liquors or Fumes.
THat there is in the Spirit of Humane Blood, such a thing, as a Chymist or a vulgar Philoso∣pher would call Hostility, or an Antipathy in reference to Acids, has been plainly enough, tho very briefly, intimated in a Passage be∣longing to the third of the precedent Titles. But yet it may not be im∣pertinent Page  178 to add in this place, that our Spirit of Humane Blood exer∣cises this Hostility against more than one sort of Acid Spirits, tho perhaps they differ not a little from one ano∣ther, as Spirit of Salt, Spirit of Nitre, Spirit and Oyl of Vitriol, Aqua For∣tis, Aqua Regia, &c. and not only against Factitious Acids, but against Natural ones too, the Spirit of Hu∣mane Blood may discover a manifest Hostility, as I found by the conflict it would make with newly express'd Juice of Lemmons which it would put into a confus'd agitation accom∣pany'd with bubbles. And this was yet the more evident, when I em∣ploy'd the Volatile Salt of Blood, that is, the Spirit in a dry form: for having squeez'd upon a parcel of this, some Juice of Lemmons, there was presently excited a great com∣motion, accompany'd not only with froth, but with noise. But (to re∣turn to the strongly Acid Liquors made by Distillation) whether the Page  179 great commotion, and froth, and hissing noise, that usually follows upon the mixing of Spirit of Hu∣mane Blood with any of these Men∣struums, do proceed from a true Hostility, or an Antipathy deserved∣ly so call'd, or else be a motion to Coalescence or Union; or an effect of the disturb'd motions proper to the differing, but now confounded, Liquors; or lastly, a consequent of some Impediment, which the new Texture of the mingled Liquors gives to the free passage of some Aethereal or other suttle Permeating Matter or Fluid, I shall not take upon me to de∣termine; but rather to what I lately told you, of the at least seeming contrariety of the Spirit of Humane Blood to Acid Spirits, I shall add (what perhaps you did not expect) that this Hostility extends even to the invisible Effluvia or Emanations of these Liquors, as may be readi∣ly seen by the following way, that I long since pitch'd upon to make Page  180 it not only visible but manifest.
This is easily done by putting any strong Acid Spirit, as of Salt, or of Nitre, &c. into a Vial somewhat wide-mouth'd, and some well de∣phlegm'd Spirit of Blood into ano∣ther, for when I purposely inclin'd these Glasses so towards one another, that their Lips did almost touch, and their respective Liquors were ready to run out, tho neither of the Li∣quors did at all visibly fume whilst they were kept asunder, tho the Glasses were unstopt, yet, as soon as the Liquors came to be approached in the way just now mention'd, the Fumes meeting each other in the Air would make little Coalitions, which would be manifestly visible in the form of ascending Smoke, which was wont at first to surprize the de∣lighted Spectators; and this pro∣duction of Smoke would continue a good while, if the Vials were not sever'd to make it cease, which upon their remove it would presently do. Page  181 I have divers times practis'd a more easy way of making these Fumes conspicuous; but it belongs more to another Paper, and what has been now deliver'd may suffice for my present purpose.
Yet it may not be improper to take this occasion, to acquaint you with an Experiment that I made, to observe what the contrary Salts, that abound in our Spirit of Blood and in some Acid Liquors, would produce, when they were combin'd and brought into a dry form. I shall therefore annex a Transcript of the Experiment I speak of, as I find it registred in one of my Note Books.
[We took some pure Volatile Salt of Humane Blood, and having just satiated it with Spirit of Nitre, we slowly evaporated away the super∣fluous moisture, that the Acid and Urinous Salts might be united into a dry Concretion, from which my design was to separate them again, the Salt of Blood in its Pristine form, Page  182 and the Spirit of Nitre in the form of Salt-peter. To effect this, we put the compounded Salt into a small Bolt-head with a long and slender neck, and then added to it a conveni∣ent quantity of Salt of Tartar, and as much distill'd Water as would suffice to make the Mixture some∣what Liquid, to promote the Action of the contrary Salts upon one ano∣ther. By which mutual Actions we suppos'd, that the Saline Spirits of Nitre, being more congruous to the fix'd Salt than to the Volatile, would forsake the Salt of Blood, (which it detain'd before from flying away,) and give it leave to sublime; and ac∣cordingly having kept the Glass, wherein the mixture was made, for a competent time in a convenient heat, we obtain'd what we look'd for; since a good proportion of fine Volatile Salt ascended in a dry form, into the Neck.]
Having put to some of the Spirit of Humane Blood, a small quantity Page  183 of exceeding strong Spirit of Nitre, there was upon the conflict of the two Liquors excited so great a quan∣tity of thick white Fumes, that I could not but wonder at it, having never seen any thing of that kind comparable to it. And these Fumes Circulating long in the Cavity of the Glass, whereof perhaps a tenth part was full of Liquor, did many of them, tho the Vessel were wide∣mouth'd, fall back and run down the sides of the Glass into the stag∣nant mixture, as if they had com∣pos'd streams of a Milky Liquor. And when at length, after these Fumes had disappear'd, we dropt in a little more of the same smoaking Spirit of Nitre, the like strange plen¦ty of white Exhalations did presently ensue, and continue to Circulate a great while in the open Glass, the Mixture in the mean while appear∣ing reddish. Being settled, and seeming to have been so discolour'd by a fattish substance, we put to it a Page  184 little Rain or Distill'd Water, and having by Filtration separated it from the Faeces, and slowly evapora∣ted the thus Clarified Liquor, the Sa∣line parts shot into Crystals much of the shape, and crossing one another much after the manner, of Stiriae of Salt-peter; but their colour after a while appear'd Yellow, as if some Oyly substance were yet mix'd with them.
N. B. Tho on several occasions the Spirit of Blood appear'd thus. Oily, yet I remember I had not long since some Distill'd from another parcel of Blood, which after having been kept a year, was limpid and colourless like an ordinary Vegetable Spirit.
Some of the forementioned Cry∣stalls being put upon well kindled Charcoals, did presently melt and burn away with a noise not unlike Salt-peter; but the flame seem'd not quite so halituous, and was more differing in colour, being not at all Blew but very Yellow. After the Page  185 deflagration was quite past, I was curious to see if any fixt substance was left upon the Coals, and found it to be somewhat odd; for it was not of a light colour, nor of an in∣coherent Body, like Ashes, but a little lump of a dirty colour'd mat∣ter, in which I could not perceive an Alcalisate tast, and indeed scarce any at all. And this brittle substance (for such it was) being held in the flame, became red hot, without ap∣pearing destroy'd by that Ignition, no more than afterwards it did by being a good while kept upon a glowing Coal.

The XV. (Secondary) Title. Of the Medicinal Vertues of Spirit of Humane Blood outwardly ap∣ply'd.
HAving resided for many years last past, in a place so well furnished with learned Physicians as London is, I was careful to decline the occasions of entrenching upon their profession. And tho that care did not always secure me quiet, yet it did it so far, as that you, to whom my circumstances are not unknown, will not I hope expect, that I should say much upon my own experience, of the Medicinal Vertues of Spirit of Humane Blood; yet since I had some few opportunities to get Try∣als made by practitioners in Physick, (who were pleas'd very willingly to make them for me,) that I may Page  187 not leave this Subject wholly un∣touch'd, I will subjoyn what oc∣curs, either to my Memory, or to my Thoughts, about it.
When I consider, that, as far as I have observ'd, we do not meet re∣gularly with any Acid Substance, (except perhaps in the Succus Pan∣creaticus) in a sound Humane Body: For the fixt Salt of Blood does it self much resemble Sea-salt, whe∣ther its Spirit be Acid or no; whereas the several parts of it, whether Solid, as Bones, or Liquid, as Blood, af∣ford in Distillation store of Liquor impregnated with Volatile Salt; I am induc'd to think it probable, that the Spirit of Humane Blood, where∣in such a Salt abounds, and where∣of it is the main and predominant Ingredient, is like to have notable o∣perations upon the Humane Body, and afford Medicines of great Effi∣cacy in many of its Diseases. And, tho against most of these it is to be internally given, yet there are some Page  188 against which it may be successful, when but Externally administred.
For, as well rectified Spirit of Humane Blood abounds with very subtile Particles, which in point of Tast, Odour, Diffusiveness and Pene∣trancy, do much resemble those of strong Spirits of Urine, of Harts∣horn, and of Sal-Armoniack; so one may very probably expect to find the same vertues in the Spirit of Blood, that Experience has manifested to be∣long to those other Spirituous Liquors.
I have seldom, if ever, seen any Medicine operate so nimbly in Fits of the Mother, as a well dephlegm'd Spirit of Sal-Armoniac; which as I formerly noted is in effect mainly a Spirit of Urine; which it self is granted to be, a Liquor separated from Blood: for this Spirit being held to the Noses of Hysterical Women, has often in a trice, to the wonder of the By-standers fetch'd them out of their Fits. Nor is this the considerablest effect that I have Page  189 had of this Spirit, for sometimes it has with a strange quickness brought to themselves Patients that were fallen to the ground, and either real∣ly were, or were judg'd to be, Epi∣leptical. And even in Agonizing Persons, where it could not re∣cover them, it would frequently for the time, bring them out of their swoons, and make them know and understand the Assistants, and perhaps speak to them too: of which, if it were needful I could give more then one instance. But I shall rather add, that if nature be not quite spent, and the case wholly desperate, this may be of great advantage, because it allows the Physician some (tho perhaps but little) time, and a good opportunity to administer other Re∣medies which the Patient, unless excited and brought to himself, would not be made to take. Of which I shall give you a memorable instance in a Patient of the very learned Dr. Willis's, who being in Page  190 the Fitt of an Apoplexy, when he was necessitated to go from her out of the Town, and leave her in that Condition, he Committed her to the care of a very Ingenious Physician, who (whether by his direction or no, I remember not) came to me to acquaint me with it, complaining that they could not hope for any success of their Remedies, in regard she was so stupid, and had shut her mouth so, that they could not get any down; whereupon I gave him, and told him the use of, a very sub∣tile Spirit that I had by me for such cases, tho I remember not, whether it were of Sal-armoniac, or some other Volatile and Liquid Alcaly; by applying which to her Nose, the Physician found he could presently make her open her Eyes, and in part come to her self; but then she would again, when the Glass was remov'd, soon relapse into her former Condi∣tion. Wherefore having by those frequent Vicissitudes gain'd some Page  191 time, and got a Medicine for his pur∣pose he then held the glass to her Nose for a good while together; by which means she so recovered her senses, that she knew the By-standers, and being exhorted to take a Medicine that was offered her, which they told her would do her much good, she understood them, and swallowed it; and tho afterwards, upon the removal of the Vial, she relaps'd into a senseless state, yet by the help of the Urinous Spirit they kept her alive, till the very brisk Medicine she had taken began to act its part, and make a Copious Evacuation, which did not only rouse her, but little by little relieve her; So that in a short time she happily escap'd a danger, that was judg'd to be very hardly, if at all, superable by any Medicines. But here I must give you notice, that in such difficult and desperate Cases I am not content that a Vial with a somewhat long neck be held to the nose, but sometimes order that little Page  192 Pellets of Lint or Cotton, or of thin rags, be dipt into the Spirit and thrust up into the Nostrils. And the same thing I would advise, if need should require it, in the administration of Spirit of Humane Blood. And as, for external uses, I make a particu∣lar Preparation of Spirit of Sal-Armoniac, or of Urine, that is more strong and penetrant, then that which is made the more ordinary way: So, if I had been furnish'd with store of Spirit of Blood, I would have hand∣led it in a not very unlike manner. And however with the little I had, I made the following Experiment, for Tryals sake. We took some dry'd Volatile Salt of Humane Blood, (being then better able to spare that than Spirit,) and put to it as much Spirit of Nitre, as would just serve to satiate it; and then by Evapora∣tion we obtain'd thence an Anomalous kind of compounded Salt, which afterwards, because we desired a Medicine in a dry form, we sublim'd Page  193 from a Convenient quantity of a well chosen fixed Alcaly, (if I mistake not, we took an equall weight of Salt of Tartar) fit to retain, not only the Phlegmatick parts, but the Oleagi∣nous too, which oftentimes lye con∣ceal'd in Volatile Salts and Liquors, wherein they do not at all at first appear, and unto which the greatest part of their foetid or offensive smell may probably be imputed. By this means we obtain'd a dry white Salt of a very piercing smell. But I had no opportunity to try this sublim'd Salt upon diseased Persons: for whose sake, I also made use of another way to bring over the Saline part of Blood in a Liquid form, (which for the use of smelling I for the most part prefer to the dry) for which pur∣pose we mix'd two parts of dry'd Humane Blood, with three parts of Lime, and then distill'd them with a pretty strong Fire, by which means we obtain'd, as we expected, a pretty deal of Spirit unaccompany∣ed with any Volatile Salt in a dry Page  194 form, which Spirit seem'd, even without Rectification, to have a stronger smell, and a more fiery tast then other Spirit of Blood, after a Rectification. And I guess'd that if we had taken more or stronger Lime, we should have had less Oyl, and a more piercing Spirit, since the Lime would probably have retain'd most of the Oyl, and perhaps all the Superfluous Moisture.
I have likewise often found, that slighter Head-aches have been cured in less (and perhaps much less) time than a quarter of an hour, by the base smell of some of these well depurated Volatile Alcalies; and if I misre∣member not, I have been relieved particularly by that of H. B.) and I have very rarely for these many years us'd, or (thanks be to God) needed any other Medicine to free my self from pains of the Head. And even Violent and durable pains of that part have been, if not quite re∣mov'd yet much lessen'd, by the same remedy often reiterated, which I have Page  195 likewise observ'd to be usually enough very effectual in faintings, especially those of Hysterical and Hypochon∣driacal Women; which makes it probable, that our Spirit of Humane Blood, which is a Liquor that in many Qualities manifestly resembles other Volatile Alcalies, (and per∣haps surpasses them,) and which, when well freed from its Oyl, can by few, if by any, be distinguisht from other Urinous Spirits, may by its odour be available in the forementi∣oned Maladies. I expect you should tell me, that the ill scent of Spirit of Blood will hinder that sex from useing it externally, to divers of whose Distempers it is the most proper. To this it may be answer'd, that most of those that find themselves in pain or danger, would be content to be eas'd or rescu'd by an unpleasant Me∣dicine. For we may apply to health, what Vespasian said of the Tax that was paid him, upon the score of Urine, Lucri bonus odor ex re qualibet. And Page  196 accordingly we see, that Ladies them∣selves ordinarily make use in such Ca∣ses of burnt Feathers, and in these and some others of Castoreum, Galbanum and Asafoetida, whose smells are offen∣sive enough to men. But for the more delicate and Nauseous Patients, one may much lessen the offensive odour of our Spirit, by long Digestions, or by reiterated, or skilful Rectifications. And if even then they cannot be recon∣cil'd to the odour of so good a Remedy, that odour may (as was formerly inti∣mated on another occasion) be cor∣rected by uniting it with a Conveni∣ent quantity of highly rectified Spirit of Wine; by which means it may perhaps (for I am not sure on't) lose somewhat of its penetrancy, as well as of its Urinous odour, but yet may remain subtile and active enough for divers good purposes. And if you would not only correct the smell of the Spirit of Blood, but make it afford a fragrant one, you may do it by dissolving in the Spirit of Page  197 Wine a convenient quantity of some Aromatick, or other well scented, Chymical Oyl, whose proportion may be found by letting it fall drop after drop into the Vial, and frequent∣ly shaking it to mingle the Liquors well, till you find by your smell, That the offensive odour of the Spirit of Blood is sufficiently obscured; or (if you will not only correct it, but perfume the Liquor) that the mix∣ture is sufficiently imbued with the grateful Odour of the Oyl, where∣with you compounded it.
I shall add on this occasion, that, if we aim chiefly at correcting or changing the smell of Spirit of Blood, we may usefully employ a Chymi∣cal Oyl, more mild or temperate than the Aromatick ones of Cinna∣mon or Cloves. For Tryal purpose∣ly made has inform'd me, that, if the Oyl of Rhodium (which is much esteem'd by perfumers) be sincerely and skilfully made, (which I fear it is not over frequently) a very few Page  198 drops of it will make an ounce of Alcohole of Wine so fragrant, that this Solution being shaken together with a convenient quantity (perhaps much less than an equal one) of well rectify'd Spirit of Humane Blood, there will emerge a mixture, that I found to have a scent brisk enough, and yet to be not only free from stink, but imbu'd, tho not strongly, with the Odoriferous Particles of the Rhodium.
I must not here omit, that di∣vers happy Practitioners, as well Physicians as profess'd Chymists, do highly extol the Oyl of Amber, a∣gainst Convulsion fits and other Di∣stempers of the Brain and Genus Ner∣vosum: And indeed Experience has so recommended some Medicines of Amber to me, that in some cases there are few that I more willingly give or take. And besides the great Character that Helmont has left of Amber dissolv'd in Spirit of Wine, Experience has brought such Credit Page  199 to it in divers cases, (for there are some cases and constitutions wherein I suspect it of too much heat) that many Patients, as well Women as Men, had much rather endure the smell, than deny themselves the be∣nefit of the Tincture or the Oyl. And if you have any such Patients, perhaps you will not be ill pleas'd to be advertiz'd, that you may ac∣cording to the formerly mentioned way, employ the high Tincture of Amber taken with Spirit of Wine; to correct the Odour, and encrease (at least in number) the Vertues of Spirit of Humane Blood. And because it requires some skill, and not seldom a pretty deal of time, to draw this Tincture from Crude Am∣ber, tho finely powder'd, I be∣thought my self of the following way, to draw speedily a strong Tin∣cture from the Oyl it self; for, tho this Oyl will not, even by long sha∣king, dissolve throughly in Spirit of Wine, as the Aromatick and other Page  200 Oyls lately mentioned will do; yet I found that by well shaking those two Liquors together, and leaving them to settle at leisure; tho they would separate into distinct Masses, yet the Spirit of Wine would even in the cold extract from the Oyl a fine Tincture of a high Yellow co∣lour, little, if at all, different from that of the Oyl it self. Of which Tincture I afterwards mix'd as much with Spirit of Blood, as suffic'd to ob∣scure the Urinous smell, and make that of the Oyl of Amber somewhat predominant, and as we judg'd, more subtile and brisk than it was before.
Three things more I have to inti∣mate concerning the external use of our Spirit of Blood. The first is, that by what has been said of the good effects it may have, when (af∣ter it has been, by the lately men∣tioned or other preparations, imbu'd with Chymical Oyls) it is smelt to, I would by no means be thought to deny, that it is after these changes Page  201 fit to be also inwardly employ'd, as I shall have ere long occasion more particularly to declare. My second Admonition shall be, that, whereas in some mixtures it will be hard to hit upon the proportion of the Chymi∣call Oyl, or other things employ'd to correct the smell of the Spirit of Blood, so exactly, but that after the mixture has had some time to settle, a separation of some oleaginous parts will be made: The bulk of the mixture may be freed from it, by pouring all into a Glass Tunnel somewhat sharp at the bottom, after the manner us'd among Chymists to separate Oyls from other Liquors, and then the mixture that will run through before the Oyl, may be kept close stopt in a Vial by it self, and the fragrant Oyl (unless it be of Cinna∣mon or Cloves) reserv'd for other uses. And whereas frequently, if not most commonly, if the Vinous Spirit were sufficiently Rectified, there will, by the Concoagulation Page  202 of the Saline and Urinous Particles, be produc'd a kind of Salt; you may either pour the Liquid part from it into another Vial, and use each of them separately without more ado, or else without thus se∣parating them, you may sublime with a very gentle warmth, as much as will ascend from the rest of the Mixture in a dry form. And this Sal Volatile Oleosumof Spirit of Blood, when it was duly prepar'd, I found to be depriv'd of its former bad scent, and perhaps endow'd with a fragrant one, and yet to have an Odour more subtile, brisk, and pier∣cing, than I had thought it reasonable to expect. The third and last thing I would advertise, is, that besides those Medicinal uses, that may be made of the Odours of Spirit of Blood Simple or Compounded, it may have considerable Vertues, ap∣ply'd in substance as a Liquor, by way of Fomentation or otherwise; which I think the more likely, be∣cause Page  203 the Spirit of Sal-Armoniac has been much commended, for mitiga∣ting the sharp pains of the Gout, and is said to have been successfully us'd in the Erysipelas. And when I con∣sider, that our Liquor is very Spi∣rituous and Penetrating, and so fit to strengthen and resolve, and also of an Alcalisate nature, which fits it to mortify Acidities, it seems very probable, that, by vertue of these and other friendly Qualities, it may, by being apply'd in its Liquid form, prove good in divers cases, where the Chyrurgions or the Physicians help is wont to be requir'd.
But 'tis high time for me to pro∣ceed, from the External to the In∣ternal uses of the Spirit of Humane Blood,
Page  204
The XVI. (Secondary) Title. Of the Medicinal Vertues of Spi∣rit of Humane Blood inwardly us'd.
I Have long been prone to think, that 'tis not necessary the num∣ber of specifically different Morbific Matters (as Physicians call actually noxious Humours or other substances) in the Humane Body, should be near so great as that of the Diseases 'tis obnoxious to; and consequently, that every Disease, that has a distinct Name assign'd to it, does not always require a distinct sort of Peccant Matter to produce it; but that the same hurtful Humour, or other A∣gent, may produce sicknesses that pass for differing ones, (and according∣ly have distinct Denominations) on∣ly as the same Morbific Agents bad Page  205 effects are diversify'd, partly by its own greater or lesser quantity, and more or less active Qualities, and part∣ly (and indeed chiefly) by the particu∣lar Natures, or Structures and Situa∣tions, of the parts that it invades. To this Opinion I have been led by divers Inducements, that I shall not now stay to set down; especially, since the probability of it may be easily deduc'd, from what frequent∣ly enough occurs among sick persons, of the Metastases of Morbific Mat∣ters; the same Acid or Sharp Hu∣mour, for instance, producing some∣times a Colic, sometimes after that a Palsey, sometimes a Cough, some∣times a Flux of the Belly, sometimes an Ophthalmi•, sometimes a violent Head-ach, sometimes Convulsions, and sometimes other Distempers; as the Peccant Humour, or other Noxi∣ous Matter, happens primarily to invade, or afterwards to be transla∣ted to, this or that particular part of the Body. And to the hitherto pro∣pos'd Page  206 Notion 'tis very agreeable, that one Remedy, by being capable victoriously to oppugn one or two of the principal kinds of Morbific Matter, may be able to cure differing Diseases; especially if it be endow'd with any variety of active Vertues. And upon this ground I am apt to think, that the Spirit of Humane Blood, skilfully Prepar'd and Ad∣ministred, may be a good Remedy in no small number of Internal Af∣fections of the Humane Body. And indeed Volatile Alcalies in general, have been in England so prosper∣ously made use of in Physick, since the year 1656, (about which time I had the good fortune to contribute so to introduce them, as to bring them by degrees into request, by di∣vulging easy ways of making them, as well as by declaring their Vertues) that I see small cause to doubt, but that they will hereafter be more ge∣nerally esteem'd and employ'd, than yet they are, and will little by little Page  207 invite Physicians to prefer them to a great many vulgar Remedies, that for want of better are yet in com∣mon use, tho they clog or weaken the Patient, and want divers advan∣tageous Qualities that may be found in Volatile Alcalies. For (to apply what has been said to our present Subject, as an instance that may serve for other Urinous Spirits) the Spirit of Humane Blood is endowed with divers Qualities, that are both Active and Medicinal. For it mor∣tifies Acid Salts, which are the cau∣ses of several Diseases, and, if I mistake not, of some that are not wont to be imputed to them. It is a great Re∣solvent, and on that score fit to open Obstructions, that produce more than a few Diseases. It is both Dia∣phoretick and Diuretick, and on both these accounts fit to assist Nature, to discharge divers Noxious Salts, and expel divers Contagious or Malignant Corpuscles that offend her. It resists Putrefaction and Coagulation of the Page  208 Blood, gives it a briskness and Spiri∣tuosity that promotes the free Cir∣culation of the Blood, to which it is Congeneal; by which means (tho not perhaps by these only) it becomes a good Cordial, and probably a∣gainst some Poysons an Antidote. And, which is none of the least, nor least extensive, Vertues, it is very friendly to the Genus Nervosum, and upon that account is like to be very proper in Fits of the, Mother (as they are call'd,) Convulsions, some sorts of Head aches, Palseys, Incipient Apo∣plexies, some sort of Asthmas, &c. It is also Balsamical in some Circum∣stances, and may have divers other Vertues that have not yet been ob∣serv'd. For a Medicine that does not weaken, not cause great Evacua∣tions, nor clog the Stomach, nor is blemish'd with the excess of any manifest Quality, but has in it self a Complex of so many useful Pow∣ers, may reasonably be suppos'd, likely to be available in more than Page  209 a few Diseases; since a good part of those that Humane Bodies are lyable to, may be powerfully oppugn'd by some of those excellent Qualities, one or more, whose Confluence may be found in the Spirit of Hu∣mane Blood.
I presume therefore that one may rationally propose it, as likely to be a good Remedy in many Distempers, especially wherein either Spirit of Urine, or the Urinous Spirit of Sal-Armoniac, have been found success∣ful Medicines; such as Hysterical Fits, Pleurisies, Coughs, some Scor∣butick Distempers, Convulsions, A∣poplexies, some kinds of Feavers, Head-aches, the Jaundise, &c. But I formerly prepar'd you not to ex∣pect that I should say much of the Virtues of the Spirit of Humane Blood (inwardly given,) upon my own personal experience. And there∣fore I shall not scruple to tell you, that Helmont himself, as little as he is apt to praise other than his own Page  210 or the Paracelsian Arcana, more than once commends the Spirit of Cruor, though that be in his sense of the Word,* not yet fully ela∣borated Humane Blood) against the Epilepsy, which he says it will cure even in adult persons, which is a Vertue he expresly denies to the Spi∣rit of Urine. And a famous Writer about the Hermetick Physick (but, if I mistake not, better vers'd in di∣vers other parts of Learning, than in Chymical Arcana,) tho he so far depretiates Spagyrical Preparations, as to commend the Utility but of a very few of them, is pleas'd to put the Distill'd Liquor of Blood into the number of those very few that he vouchsafes a good Character to.
I am the more inclin'd to give Credit to these praises of Spirit of Blood, because, as I remember, this was the Medicine that I made use of in the following Case. A young Page  211 Lady, in whose family the Con∣sumption was an hereditary disease, was molested with a Violent and Stubborn Cough, that was judg'd consumptive, and look'd upon by those that gave her Physick, as not to be cured by any other way, then a seasonable remove from London into the French Air; but she was already so far gone and weakened, and there remain'd so much of the Winter, that 'twas judg'd she would die be∣fore the season would make it any way fit for her to undertake so long and troublesome a journey; but if she could be kept alive till the end of the Spring, there would be some hopes she might in France recover. On this occasion being solicited by some friends of hers and mine, to try what I could do to preserve her, I sent her some Spirit of Humane Blood very carefully prepar'd and rectify'd, (to which I gave some name that I do not well remember,) upon the use of which she manifestly Page  212 mended, notwithstanding the un∣friendliness of the Season; insomuch that about the end of February, she had gain'd relief and strength enough to venture to cross the Seas, and make a journey to Montpellier, whence in Autumn she brought home good looks and recovery. If I much misremember not, the same Spirit of Blood, made very pure and subtile by the help of a Lamp Fur∣nace, was the Medicine that I put into the Hands of an Ingenious and Successful Physician, who complain'd to me that he had a Patient, that had quite puzzled him, as well as baffled the endeavours of other emi∣nent Doctors, whom the difficulty of the case had invited at several times to try their skill upon him. This man was frequently Obnoxious to such violent and tormenting fits of the Head-ach, that he could not endure the light, and was offended with almost every noise or motion that reach'd his Ears; insomuch Page  213 that he was forc'd to give over his Profession, which was that of a Tay∣lor: But upon the constant use of the before mentioned Spirit of Blood, (for the other Medicines he took were much inferior to it, and had not before been available) he received such relief, as made him with great joy and thankfulness re∣turn to the exercise of his Trade, and the Physician, to whom I gave the remedy for him, told me one cir∣cumstance, too considerable to be here omitted▪ Namely, That the Patient having by our famous Har∣vey's advice, been us'd to bleed once in two or three Months, the Physici∣an counsell'd him, notwithstanding his recovery, not abruptly to break off his ancient custom, and the Patient thereupon sent for the same Chyrur∣geon that had been formerly wont to let him Blood, and to complain of the great badness of his Blood; but when this Chyrurgeon who knew not what had been done to the Patient, Page  214 came to open a Vein again, and per∣ceived what kind of Blood it afford∣ed, he was so surpriz'd, that he stop'd the operation, and asked the man with wonder, how he came by such Florid Blood, adding, that 'twas pitty to deprive him of so well con∣ditioned a Liquor.
The Medicinal Vertues hitherto mentioned belong to the Spirit of Humane Blood, as 'tis pure and simple: But 'tis not improbable that it may acquire other, and perhaps nobler Faculties; if it be dexterously corrected, diversified, or united with fit Ingredients, that is, in a word, skilfully altered or compounded.
These things may be performed several ways. For they may be done either by uniting as well as one can, by long digestion, or frequent Cohobations, the Spirit of Humane Blood with the Oyls, Salt, and (if need be) Phlegm, of the same Con∣crete, into such a kind of Mixture as some Chymists call Clyssus.
Page  215Or, 2. By uniting the Spirit of Blood with Acids, as with Spirit of Nitre, Spirit of Vinegar, Spirit of Verdegrease, Oyl of Vitriol, &c. and employing these mixtures, either in their Liquid form, or reduced by Evaporation into Chrystals or other Salts; and making use of these either as they are, or after a kind of Analysis of them.
Or, 3. By uniting our Spirit with Metalline Solutions, as of Gold, Silver, Mercury, and with solution of Mini∣um made with Spirit of Vinegar, by mixture of which Liquor with Spirit of Blood, and a slow Evaporation of them, I remember I have had pret∣ty store of finely figured Chry∣stals.
Or, 4. By dissolving in Spirit of Blood carefully Dephlegm'd Sul∣phur opened with Salt of Tartar.
Or else, By dissolving in it some Metalline Bodies, as Copper, Zink, and Iron, which last will afford a Martial Liquor, that differing much Page  216 from other preparations of Steel, that are wont to be made with Acids, may probably have some Vertues, distinct from those of the known Remedies made of that Metal.
But I cannot stay to enumerate the several ways whereby the Spirit of Humane Blood may be made ser∣viceable to the Medicinal Art. Yet one Preparation there is, which tho I have already taken notice of in the foregoing Title, and therefore can scarce mention without some repeti∣tion, yet I think I ought not to pre∣•ermit it on this occasion; partlybe∣cause whereas it was formerly pro∣pos'd with respect only to the out∣ward uses of it, I shall now consider it with reference to the inward; and partly because by this way of pro∣ceeding we may at once correct, diversifie and compound our Spi∣rit of Blood.
This Operation may be perform'd two ways, whereof the former is more simple than the latter. The Page  217 first is, to add to well Rectify'd Spi∣rit of Blood, a double weight, or a∣bout an equal one, (as the Liquors, especially the Volatile Alcaly, are more or less strong) of Alcohole of Wine. For these Liquors being well shaken together, will in very great part coagulate into Salt, which with a very gentle heat will su∣blime in a dry form, + in which I found it to have lost almost all its offensive smell. And tho against this way of proceeding I know it may be objected, (as was formerly intimated) that the efficacy of the Medicine may, as well as the Uri∣nous smell, be much weakned by this Preparation; yet I found this Salt to retain a considerable degree of Quickness and Penetrancy, which its Volatility kept me from thinking strange. And experience has per∣swaded me, that divers of these compounded, or, if I may so stile them, Resulting Salts, (which some Chy∣mists call Salia Enixa, for all agree Page  218 not in the Sense of that name) tho they seem to have their Activity clog'd, may have considerable ope∣rations both in Chymistry and Phy∣sick. And why the Emergent Salt we speak of, may not be of that number, I see no sufficient cause; (N. B.) especially since such a kind of Mixture, tho made with another Urinous Spirit, has had such effects in Feavers, as I thought extraordi∣nary. Nor is the Liquor that our Compounded Salt leaves behind, to be thrown away: since if it be De∣phlegmed, it may afford a not De∣spicable Liquor, both for Medical and Mechanical uses, of which it may here suffice to have given you in ge∣neral this hint.
And if the more simple way of altering the Spirit of Humane Blood, be carry'd on a little further, by dissolving in the Alcohole of Wine, before the conjunction of the two Spirits be made, a convenient pro∣portion (as perhaps a Twentyeth or Page  219 Twenty-fourth part) of an Essential Chymical Oyl, as of Cloves, Anise-seeds, Marjoram, &c. the Volatile Salt that will be sublim'd from this Mixture, will not only be depriv'd of its stink, but endow'd with the smell and the Relish of the Oyl; which by being thus united with a Salt very subtile and friendly to na∣ture, will less overpower and offend the Brain and Stomach, than meer Chymical Oyls are wont to do; and being associated with such Agile and penetrating Corpuscles, will with them gain admission into the more inward Recesses of the Body, and there exercise the Vertues that belong to the Vegetables that afford∣ed the Oyls, or at least to the Oyls themselves. In these odoriferous Aromatick Mixtures the Oleaginous Particles are, by the intervention of the Saline ones, brought to mix readily with other Liquors, and even with Aqueous Vehicles, and to con∣tinue long enough mix'd, for the Page  220 Patient to take them commodiously. And thus by this one method there may be a multitude of Salia Volati∣lia Oleosa, that is, of pleasing, subtile and efficacious Remedies for inward uses, prepar'd, even as many as the Physician or Chymist shall please to make Essential Oyls, (or others that will dissolve in Alcohole of Wine;) and if these be drawn from Cephalick Plants, as Marjoram, Rosemary, La∣vender, &c. or from Cephalick Spices, as Nutmegs, Cinnamon, &c. they will probably afford very brisk and grate∣ful Medicines to relieve and comfort the Brain and Spirits; as they may the Heart, Liver, and other Viscera, if in the sublimation the Saline Par∣ticles of Blood be associated with those of Oyls, drawn from Vege∣tables whose Vertues do peculiarly respect those parts.
Other ways might be here pro∣pos'd of making Remedies, whereof the Spirit of Blood should be the main ingredient. But I willingly Page  221 leave that work to your self, and those of your profession, if you think fit to prosecute it; since my present task does not require that I should write like what I am not, a profess'd Physician, but like what I endeavour to be, a Diligent Natural Historian. And for the same reason I purposely forbear, to insert here some Chymi∣cal processes that I have met with of Remedies that admit of Distill'd Blood, tho I have also declin'd the mention of them for two other Rea∣sons, one, that the Authors do not recommend them upon their own Experience, and the other, that these Medicines being much, more com∣pounded than those I lately propos'd, wherein our Spirit is mingled but with some one Chymical Oyl or o∣ther, diluted with Alcohole of Wine; their preparations are less fit for my Design; which leads me to consider the Effects of Humane Blood upon Patients, less as they are Sanative, than as they are Signs Page  222 of Qualities, whose knowledge tends to the discovery of the Nature of Spirit of Humane Blood, and so of that of Blood it self.
And this, Sir, it may suffice to have at present set down, touching the History of the Spirit of Humane Blood; of which, and of the other parts constituting that Red Body, or obtainable from it, I might have given you a far less incomplete Ac∣count, if I had had more leisure; and if, for want of Materials to make Experiments upon the entire Liquor, and the Concreted and Serous Parts of it distinctly, and especially to af∣ford a sufficient quantity of the Spi∣rit, I had not been so straitned that I was fain to leave many things un∣try'd, and to try some others in much less quantities, and much more unac∣curately than otherwise should have been done by,
Sir,
your, &c.

AN APPENDIX TO THE MEMOIRS FOR THE HISTORY OF Humane Blood.
HAving elsewhere mentioned the Reasons that mov'd me to think it fit to subjoyn an Appen∣dix to each of the Natural Histories, that I drew up, or design'd, of parti∣cular Subjects; it would be needless Page  224 to trouble you with them in this place, where it may therefore suf∣fice to advertise you, that the fol∣lowing Particulars I have thrown together as they occur'd to me, to be annexed to the foregoing Histo∣ry of Humane Blood, are made up of two sorts: Some which through haste or otherwise were Praetermit∣ted, when they should have been rang'd under one or other of the foregoing Titles, and so are answe∣rable to those, that in the First Part of these Memoirs were call'd Parali∣pomena; and others that are for the most part of kin to those, that are there stil'd Addenda; tho some of them may be judg'd to deserve better the name of Supernumerary, which yet I thought fit to let pass among the rest, because, tho they do not di∣rectly belong to any of the distinct Titles of our History, yet they may obliquely be refer'd to one or other of them, or are at least capable of being made some way subservient Page  225 to the general Design of the History it self. But the paucity of the par∣ticulars that I am at present furnish∣ed with, makes me fear it may fa∣vour of Ostentation, if in so much penury of matter I should curiously refer the Particulars that now occur to me to the differing Titles, Prima∣ry and Subordinate, that have been enumerated in the Schemes of our intended Histories. And therefore, till I be better stock'd with materi∣als, I shall forbear to make Scrupu∣lous References of them, or so much as constantly distinguish the Parali∣pomena, from the other Addenda▪ contenting my self to refer some of them in a general way, and in the order they Chance to come to hand, to that part of the Memoirs, whe∣ther the Second, the Third, or the Fourth, to which they respectively seem most to belong.
'Tis hop'd that neither Connecti∣on nor style will be expected, in loose Notes hastily set down at seve∣ral Page  226 times, to secure the Matters of fact, then fresh in Memory, from being, as to any necessary Circum∣stances, forgotten.
Some Tryals may seem to have been made extravagantly and quite at random, which perhaps would be otherwise thought of, but that I judg'd it not worth while, especially writing in haste, to spend time in setting down the Inducements I had to make them, or the Aims I had in them.
I am well aware, that some few of the following Tryals may seem but Repetitions of others, recited in the Body of the History. But these were added on purpose, that where the Event of both Tryals was the same, they might confirm one another, which, where the subject has lain uncultivated, is oftentimes a desireable thing; and where they disagree in any considerable Cir∣cumstances, their Difference may occasion further Tryals, and in the Page  227 mean time keep us from building Dogmatical Conclusions upon the Circumstances wherein they differ.
Particulars referable to the Second Part of the History.
Experiment. I.
THe Proportion of the substances obtainable from dry'd Humane Blood, being as I formerly noted, very difficult, to be determin'd, be∣cause of that Difficulty, and the Im∣portance of the Inquiry, I thought fit to employ some Blood, that I made a shift to collect since the wri∣ting of the Second Part of the fore∣going History, in making another Experiment, that we may make the nearer and safer estimate, of the Quantities of the distinct substances sought after. For this end I caus'd Page  228 Twelve Ounces of dry'd Blood to be carefully distill'd by an expert La∣borant, well admonished of the Diffi∣culty of his Task, and the exactness he was to aim at in performing it. The Distillation being ended, the substances obtain'd were brought me, with this note of their Quanti∣ties. Twelve Ounces of dry'd Hu∣mane Blood yielded, of Volatile Salt and Spirit together five Ounces, of which we pour'd off from the wet Salt ʒxiij+. 54. gr. So that their remain'd ℥xiij+. ʒij+. 6. gr. Of Vo∣latile Salt; of foetid Oyl there were two Ounces, of Caput Mortuum four Ounces, and two Drams. So that in spite of all his care there was lost, by sticking to the Retorts and other Glasses (which I presum'd, retain'd little else than the more viscous Oyl and phlegm,) and by avolation of some more subtil parts (especially upon pouring the Liquors from Ves∣sel to Vessel,) about Six Drams. The four Ounces and two Drams Page  229 of Caput Mortuum being diligently calcin'd, afforded but Six Drams and a half of Ashes: Of which very great Decrement, the Accension and Consumption of the more fixed Olea∣ginous Part seems to be the cause. And if it be so, we may suppose, that there is a far greater portion of Oyl, in Humane Blood, than has been hitherto taken notice of. These Ashes were not white or Gray, as those of other Bodies use to be, but of a Red∣dish Colour, much like that of Bricks; and yet the watchful La∣borant affirm'd, he could easily know them to be true Ashes, because that whilst there remain'd any thing Oily or Combustible in the Caput Mortuum, it would look like a throughly kind∣led Charcoal (which it would con∣tinue to do far longer, than one would expect:) But when that Combustible substance was quite wasted, the remaining Caput Mor∣tuum would look in the fire like dead and ordinary Ashes, tho, when they Page  230 were Cold, they appear'd and con∣tinued Red. These Ashes being care∣fully Elixiviated, afforded five Scru∣ples of White-fixt Salt, besides a little, which being casually got into the Contiguous sand, and thence reco∣ver'd by water, and reduc'd to the like White Salt, amounted to about a Scruple more. So that their remain∣ed for the Terra damnataFourteen Scruples & about a half, that is, a good deal above twice the weight of the Salt, whence it appears, that accord∣ing to this Analysis, the pure fixt Salt of Humane Blood is but be∣tween the 57th and 58th part even of dry'd Blood, and therefore probably amounts but to the 150th or perhaps the 170th part (in weight) of Blood, as it flows from the Vein opened by a lancet: and the Fixt Earth or Ter∣ra damnata, is to the dry'd Blood that affords it, as 19. and about a half to 1.
Page  231
Experiment II.
IN regard the foregoing Experi∣ment, and another of the like nature formerly mentioned were made with dried and pul∣verable Blood of several Persons put together, though I knew it would be scarce possible, in so small a quan∣tity of Blood, as I could obtain at once from one Person, to find out with any accurateness, the quantities of the several substances, it was ca∣pable of affording; yet, to be able to make some tolerable estimate grounded upon experience, I was in∣vited to make a tryal, whose success, though in one part of it unlucky, was registred as follows.
An entire parcel of Humane Blood weighing ten ounces and 73 gr. be∣ing slowly distilled to dryness in a Head and Body on a digestive Fur∣nace, Page  232 afforded of phlegmatick Li∣quor ℥vij+. ʒij+. 47. gr. and of Caput Mortuum, or rather of dry substance ℥ij+. ʒij. This pulvera∣ble matter being beaten and put into a Retort, and distill'd in sand by degrees of Fire afforded ʒij+. 48. gr. of Oyl. But there happen'd an un∣lucky mistake about the Salt and Spirit: for after the latter was pour∣ed off, which weighed but 48. gr. the wet Salt which stuck in good quantity to the lateral and upper parts of the Receiver, instead of have∣ing been wash'd out, as it should have been, with the phlegm of the same Blood, was wash'd out with distill'd water, whence we obtain∣ed by sublimation into the neck of a glass Egg, ʒj+. 5. gr. of dry Salt. But by the tast of the distill'd Water whence it was sublim'd, it appear'd that all the Salt had not been raised: which invited me to put to it as much good Spirit of Salt as I supposed to be at least sufficient to satiate it, with Page  233 design to try, whether by evaporat∣ing this Mixture to dryness, and sub∣liming Salt by the help of an Alcaly, we might not recover all, or almost all, the Volatile Salt, that had been somewhat fix'd by the Acid Spirit.
The Retort being cut, that the Caput Mortuum might be taken out, it was found to weigh ʒvj+. 12. gr. which being carefully calcined yield∣ed but two Scruples and four grains of Ashes, which the Laborant said were Red. These being Elixiviated, afforded eighteen grains of Salt, be∣sides the remaining Earth or Ter∣restrial substance, which, I keep by me, because, notwithstanding all the violence of fire it has undergone, 'tis of a Red Colour, which seems to some to have an Eye of Purple in it.

Experiments belonging to the Pri∣mary Title of the Natural, Hi∣story of Humane Blood.
Experiment III.
SPirit of Vinegar being put upon the florid Superficies of a parcel of Humane Blood, did very quick∣ly deprive it of its fresh Scarlet Co∣lour, and make it of a dark or dirty Colour.
Experiment IV.
THe Juice of a Lemmon squeez'd upon the Florid Surface of Blood, did presently somewhat impair the colour, but did not appear to alter it any thing near so much, as the Spirit of Vinegar had done.
Page  235
Experiment V.
JUice of Orange chang'd the Co∣lour of the Florid Surface of Blood, less than Juice of Lemmons had done.
Experiment VI.
THe Black or lower part of a Portion of Humane Blood be∣ing turn'd uppermost, and thereby expos'd to the Air, within half or three quarters of an hour, (some∣what more or less) acquired by the Contact of it, a pleasant and florid colour.
Experiment VII.
BUt if upon the Black Surface of the Blood some good Urinous Page  236 Spirit (as that of Sal-Armoniack) were dropt, there would be an al∣teration produced in a trice, and a pleasant Red colour, tho perhaps somewhat inferiour to that produc'd by the contact of the Air, would presently appear on the Surface of the Blood.
Experiment VIII.
FIxt Alcalies, or Lixiviate Salts resolv'd Per deliquium, did like∣wise alter the Black Superficies of the Blood to a Red colour, but not so Florid or Pleasant, as that pro∣duced by the Urinous Spirit above mentioned.
Experiment IX.
THe freshly drawn Juice of the Leaves of Scurvygrass, being Page  237 dropt upon the Black Superficies of a lump of Humane Blood, seemed presently to make some change in the colour of it, making us judge it somewhat Reddish and inclinable to Floridness.
The seven foregoing Notes sup∣pose it to be already known, that when healthy Blood is suffered to settle in a Porringer, that Surface of the Concreted Part, which is expos'd to the Air, will be adorned with a fine Red colour, and if the same Mass be turned upside down, that which before was the lower Surface of it, will appear of a very dark and blackish colour.
Experiment X.
HAving for tryals sake almost filled a Vial capable of con∣taining by guess near a pound of Humane Blood, with a mixture of Page  238 that Liquor, and some rectify'd Spi∣rit of Wine, whose proportion I cannot remember, but guess it was a fourth, or eighth part: At the end of above three years, looking upon the same Glass, stop'd with no∣thing but a Cork, we found it coagu∣lated, or, to speak more warily in a consistent form. And the Vessel be∣ing unstop'd, there appeared no sign of Putrefaction in the Blood; and having smelt to it, we could not perceive that it did at all stink: So Balsamick a Vertue has Dephlegmed Spirit of Wine, to preserve Humane Blood.
Experiment XI.
WE took a piece of Fibrous or Concreted Blood, of the bigness of a large Bean (or therea∣bouts) and having put it into a small Glass Vessel with a flattish bottom, Page  239 we poured on it as much highly rectify'd▪ Vinous Spirit, as might serve to cover it, tho it had been twice thicker than it was; then we lightly cover'd this Open-mouth'd glass with another, and set the Ves∣sel in a quiet place, that the Vinous Spirit might have leisure to imbibe the serous or aqueous parts of the Blood, and thereby harden that yet soft substance; and in effect it quick∣ly seemed to have gain'd a superfi∣cial Crust, but the internal parts continuing yet soft, we left the Li∣quor upon the Blood for a day or two longer, and then we found, that the action of the Liquor had quite penetrated the lump of Blood, and made it moderately hard and fri∣able.
This Experiment, having been made in the cold, may much con∣firm a Tryal elsewhere mentioned, to have been made to the same pur∣pose; and both of them together induc'd me to fear that two or three Page  240 ingenious Writers, that in their Chy∣mical Receipts prescribe Solutions and Tinctures of Concreted Blood in Spirit of Wine, have set down the Pompous Processes wherein these Operations are prescrib'd, rather ac∣cording to Conjectures than Experi∣ence.
Experiment XII.
IT may be of some use to the Spe∣culative, to know how much Volatile Salt of Blood is dissoluble in Water or Phlegm; and therefore having caused an ounce of Distilled Water (for common Water, because of some Saltishness that usually ac∣companies it, would not have been so proper on this occasion) to be carefully weigh'd out, we put into it, little by little, some dry and white Volatile Salt of Blood, and shook it well into the Liquor, to Page  241 make it disperse the better; we al∣low'd it also a competent time for solution, and by this means we found, that ℥i. of Water would dis∣solve at least ʒij. that is, a fourth part of its weight of dry Salt, and that in the cold. For afterwards by the help of heat, we made the same Liquor dissolve near five and twenty Grains more. In which last part of the Experiment I had a further aim, which was to try, whether upon the Refrigeration of the Liquor, the dissolv'd Salt would not shoot into Crystals of observable Figures. But the event answered not at that time my desire; yet left me not without some intention to reiterate the Expe∣riment, if I shall get another oppor∣tunity.
Page  242
POST-SCRIPT.
Experiment XIII.
WE put the above mentioned Solution into a Retort, to be drawn off with a pretty quick heat, (which on this occasion we prefer'd to a much slower one) and thereby obtain'd a Distill'd Liquor, that contain'd all the Volatile Salt, save a little that escaped in a dry form; which Liquor tasted strong enough to pass for quite, or at least almost, as brisk a Liquor, as mode∣rate Spirit of Blood drawn the com∣mon way, and consequently disco∣ver'd near enough, what proportion should be taken, of the Aqueous In∣gredient to the Saline when one would make such a Spirit. The knowledge of which Proportion may probably ease us of some Try∣als, Page  243 that would otherwise be neces∣sary to find it out, when we are (as we may often be) less stored with Spirit than with Volatile Salt, and desire to employ this in a Liquid form; in which we are wont to call it, for distinctions sake, the Aqueous (not the Phlegmatick) Spirit of Blood.
If opportunity had not been want∣ing, we would have try'd, whether by repeating the Distillation twice or thrice, a better or stricter union of the Salt and Liquor would not have been effected: and this the rather, because having ordered the Vial that contain'd this Aqueous Spirit, in which the Water had been, if I may so speak, Superonerated to be kept stopt during a Frosty Night, we per∣ceived at the bottom of the Glass (what we had miss'd of before) a pretty deal of Volatile Salt, coagu∣lated or shot into Crystals, tho the Crystals that were this way obtain'd, Page  244 were fine and clear, and some of them larger than Spangles, yet being much more numerous than we de∣sired, by adhering closely and con∣fusedly enough to one another, they kept us from being able to discover the Figure of particular Grains, and made me somewhat doubt, whether the single Crystals were all of them of the same shape; all that I could clear∣ly discern, being, that divers of those Concretions were flat, thin Plates with fine Rectilinear Angles that in∣clin'd us to think, that if the whole Plains could have been perfectly discovered their broadest Surface would have been found Hexagonal, or of some Polygone Figures very near of kin to that.
Experiment XIV.
WE put an ounce of Distilled Water, wherein we dis∣solv'd Page  245 as much Volatile Salt of Hu∣mane Blood, as it would well take up, into a Glass Egg, and exposed it during a Frosty Night to congeal: which we did with design to disco∣ver, whether, as the Saltness that is in Sea Water keeps it here in Eng∣land from freezing, (at least in ordi∣nary Winters,) so the Volatile Salt of Humane Blood, which much re∣sembles the other in Tast, would have the like effect upon Water, especially if it were fully impregna∣ted therewith. To this Conjecture the event was answerable, the Frost having produced no Ice in our solu∣tion, nor having so much as made any of the Salt manifestly shoot, (as I wish'd it had done, hoping thereby to discover somewhat about the Figu∣ration of the Salt of Humane Blood.)
And, tho afterwards we removed it into a Frigorifick Mixture, that would probably have frozen Beer and Ale, and perhaps the weaker sort of French Wine; yet we did not Page  246 perceive it to glaciate any part of our solution, but only made it let fall a pretty deal of Matter, that seemed to be Feculent, (for what it was, I had not opportunity to exa∣mine.)
Experiment XV.
SEa-salt dissolv'd in Water ren∣ders that Liquor much more difficult to be frozen, than it was before; and yet being joyn'd with Ice or Snow, the other Ingredient of our Frigorifick Mixture, it does, when outwardly apply'd, very much conduce to the Artificial Congelati∣on of it, which usually would not succeed without it. Wherefore to try whether, as Volatile Salt of Hu∣mane Blood, being dissolved in Wa∣ter, did, as was formerly noted, hinder it from freezing, so it would outwardly apply'd highly promote Page  247 its Glaciation; we mixed by guess about a Scruple of this Salt with a convenient quantity of beaten Ice, and having put into this Mixture a somewhat slender Pipe of Glass with Common Water in it, we found, af∣ter a while, the Water that lay in the lower part of the Glass Vessel, and was surrounded by the Mixture, was turned into Ice.
Experiment XVI.
TO try some suspicions I had about the Saline and Aqueous Parts, that I thought might he con∣cealed in the Fibrous or Consistent part of Humane Blood, I caused some of it to be in an open and shal∣low Glass exposed to the Air in a Frosty Night, and the next morning found it to be lightly frozen, and the Surface of the Ice prettily figur'd with resemblances of Combs, with Page  248 Teeth on both sides or edges; on which account these Figures did not ill resemble those, that I have oftentimes obtained, by slowly coa∣gulating into Salt, a solution of Sal-Armoniack made in Common Wa∣ter.
In the Second Part of the forego∣ing Memoirs, I have not said any thing of the Medicinal Vertues of Humane Blood it self, (for those of the Spirit belong to the Fourth Part) and, tho I might now, if I thought fit, say something not impertinent to that Subject, in this Appendix, both out of some Printed Books and my own observations, yet I now forbear to do it, not only for a reason that 'tis not necessary I should here declare, but because four or five Processes that I have met with a∣bout Humane Blood in Paracelsus, Burgravius,(famous for his Bioly∣chnium made of that Subject) and one or two more, about the Transplan∣tation Page  249 of Diseases by means of the Patients Blood, are such, as either I do not well understand, because of their being (probably on purpose) obscurely pen'd, or seem in them∣selves unlikely, of which sort is the Biolychnium, or Lamp of Life, in which 'tis pretended that the Blood is so prepar'd, that the state of Health of the Person whose it is, may be discover'd by the manner of the burning of the Flame it affords, (tho he be perhaps at a great di∣stance from it,) and his Death by its Extinction. Besides that, as I have elsewhere noted, some Circumstances relating to the Ashes of Humane Blood, make me doubt, whether some of these Processes were not rather the Products of Fancy than Experience. And, tho I think those Medicines less improbable, that with∣out much destroying the Texture of the Blood by Fire, aim at transplant∣ing Diseases by its intervention, yet Page  250 I thought fit to decline transcribing the forementioned Medicines, till Experience shall warrant me to do it. And I shall also at present for∣bear to set down my own Tryals, because I have not yet seen the E∣vents of them. But yet I shall in∣vite you to endeavour with me to prepare two, that, if they succeed, may afford, especially the last of them, considerable Medicines. The first Medicine that I attempted, was, by putting to Salt of Tartar Oyl of Humane Blood instead of Oyl of Turpentine: and by keeping them long, and stirring them frequently, in the open Air, to make such a Sapo∣nary Concretion, as is not unknown to many in London, by the name of Matthews's Corrector, which as he made it with Common Oyl of Tur∣pentine, tho it seem but a slight Composition, is yet esteemed and im∣ploy'd with good success, by some Doctors of Physick and other Practi∣tioners in London. To make the Page  251 other Medicine, we endeavoured to unite by long Digestion, the Salt, Spirit, and Oyl of Humane Blood, into a Mixture, which some Chymists (for their Terms are not by all of them used in the same sense) call a Clyssus. But having begun this, without having had time to finish it, we shall say no more of it, but that divers Chy∣mists may not improbably look upon this sort of Compositions, as one of the noblest sort of Pre∣parations that many a Drug is ca∣pable of.

Particulars referable to the Third Part of the History.
Experiment. I.
A Young Man having bled into a Porringer, and the Blood having been kept several hours, that a sufficient separation might be made of the Coagulated or consist∣ent part and the fluid, the fibrous por∣tion and the Serum were separately weighed: and the difference of the two masses in point of weight was not so great as one would have ex∣pected, the curdled part of the Blood weighing about six Ounces, and the Serous part not many drams from that weight. This Tryal is here set down by comparing it with some others, what difference there is be∣tween the Bloods of sound Persons, Page  253 as to the proportion of the Serum, and the concreted part.
Experiment. II.
HUmane Urine, having first (that I know of) by the very ingenious Mr. Hook, and often∣times by me, been observ'd, when frozen, to have on the surface of the Ice, figures not ill resembling Combs or Feathers; the great affinity gene∣rally supposed to be betwixt Ʋrine and the Serum of Blood, made me think fit to try at once whether this last nam'd Liquor would freeze with such a degree of Cold, as would easi∣ly, and yet not very easily glaciate water, and whether, in case it should freeze, the Ice would have a surface figur'd like that of frozen Urine. But, having for this purpose exposed some Serum of Humane Blood to the Cold Air, in two freezing nights Page  254 consecutively, the Serum was not found to congeal, tho some Grumous parts of the same Blood did, as has formerly been noted, yet I scarce doubted, but an exceeding hard frost would have produc'd, at least a thin Plate of Ice upon the surface of our Liquor. And to confirm this Con∣jecture, we took the same Serum, and having strained it through a Lin∣nen cloath, to separate the Liquor as much as by that way we could, from any clotted or Fibrous Parts, that might have lain conceal'd in it, we put it into a shallow, concave glass, and laid that upon some of our Frigorifick mixture, made of Ice and Salt, which we have described, and often made use of, in the History of Cold. By this means the exposed Serum, being frozen from the bottom upwards, there appeared here and there upon the Ice contiguous to the Air, cer∣tain Figures, that did not ill resem∣ble those of Conglaciated Urine.
Page  255
Experiment. III.
HAving formerly had occasion to observe that Mans Urine would tolerably well serve for what they call an invisible Ink: and have∣ing consider'd (when I remembred this) the great Affinity that is sup∣pos'd to be between Urine and the Serum of Blood, I thought fit to try, whether the latter might not be em∣ploy'd like the former to make a kind of invisible Ink, To this effect we took some Serum of Humane Blood, and having dipt a new Pen in it, we trac'd some Characters upon a piece of white Paper, and having suffer'd them to dry on, we held the unwritten side of the Paper over the Flame of a Candle, keeping it always stirring, that it might not take fire. By which means the Let∣ters that had been written, appear∣ed Page  256 on the upper surface of the Paper, being tho, not of an Inky Blackness, yet of a Colour dark enough to be easily legible and very like to some others that having been purpose∣ly written with fresh Urine, and made visible, by heat, were com∣par'd with them.
Particulars referable to the Fourth Part of the History.
I confess, the Defectiveness of our Historical knowledge of Hu∣mane Blood extravasated, has been such, that among the Authors I have had occasion to peruse, I have met with so few matters of fact deliver∣ed upon their own knowledge, that the things I have thought fit to trans∣cribe out of their Books into this little tract, do scarce all of them together amount to half a sheet of Page  257 Paper, But yet I would not impute this Penury, either to the Laziness or the Ignorance of Writers, but rather to this that they wanted some Person, exercised in designing Natural Histo∣ries to excite their Curiosity, and direct their Attention; there being many that would enquire, if they knew what Questions were fit to be ask'd, about a propos'd subject, as for instance Humane Blood, and what Researches ought to be made, to discover its nature. Upon this ac∣count, I hope that after some time the foregoing Scheme of Titles, and the Papers that refer to it, will give occasion to a great many more Ex∣periments and Observations about the Blood, (and perhaps other Li∣quors of the Humane Body) than hitherto have been published by others, or are now imparted by me. Which last words I set down, because I would not be thought guilty of the vanity of pretending to have near exhausted the subject I have treated Page  258 of; since besides other deficiencies, I now perceive that I wholly omit∣ted a considerable Title which might either have been refer'd to the Pri∣mary ones of the first order, or em∣ploy'd as a kind of Preliminary to the Secondary Titles of the History of the Spirit of Blood. This preter∣mitted Title should have been of the several ways of Distilling Hu∣mane Blood; since according to these, the produc'd Spirit, Salt, &c. may be considerably diversify'd.
Upon this account I thought fit, to distil three Portions of dry'd Blood, each with a differing Addi∣tament. The first with a Mineral Alcaly, Quicklime: the next with a Vegetable Alcaly, Calcin'd Tartar: and the third with a Sulphureous A∣cid, Oyl of Vitriol. And, tho some Accidents kept me from prosecu∣ting the Tryals as I desir'd, yet the first having succeeded indifferent well, and the two others not ha∣ving wholly miscarried, I shall sub∣joyn Page  259 the Accounts of all three as they were set down in my Notes.
Having observed that divers Bo∣dies, when they were Distill'd with Quick lime, afforded Liquors differ∣ing from those they would have yielded, if they had been distilled, either per se, or with some Vulgar Additaments; we took ℥v. of con∣creted, but not dry'd Humane Blood, and having mixed it with an equal weight of Quick-lime, (such as I could procure, but not so strong as I have often seen,) we distilled it by degrees of Fire in a Retort placed in Sand, by which means we obtain'd a large Proportion of Red∣dish Spirituous Liquor, which did not seem considerably Phlegmatick; together with some Oyl, which was but in very small quantity, the rest being probably kept back, (and perhaps some of it destroy'd) by the Lime: and of this little Oyl that did come over, there was a small portion that sunk in the Spirit, Page  260 the rest swimming upon it.
The above mentioned Spirit being put into a small Head and Body, was set into a Digestive Furnace, to Rectify at leisure with a very gentle heat, and the Receiver was three or four times shifted, that we might observe what difference, if any, there would be betwixt the successively ascending Portions of Liquor. The first Spirit that came over did not smell near so rank as that is wont to do that is distill'd per se. This Ob∣servation belongs also to the three or four succeeding Portions of Li∣quor: probably, because the Lime had better freed the Spirit of the first Distillation from the Faetid Oyl, many of whose Particles are wont, tho unperceivedly, to mingle with it when it is drawn over without Additament. The Rectify'd Spirit, which was clear and colourless, had a tast much stronger than its smell; for a small drop of it upon the Tongue, had something of Fiery∣ness Page  261 that was surprizing, and lasted longer than one would wish; which made me doubt, whether the Spiri∣tuous part of the Blood had not car∣ry'd up with it, some of the Fiery parts of the Quick-lime; which doubt, if future Tryals resolve in the Affirmative, one may expect some uncommon effects from such a Spi∣rit, which in this case would be en∣riched with a kind of Volatilis'd Al∣caly, a thing much desir'd by many Chymists and Physicians. Upon oc∣casion of this suspition, we dropt a little of it into a strong solution of Sublimate in fair Water, and it seemed at the first contact to make a Precipitate a little enclining to Yel∣low, (as I have observed the Saline parts of Quicklime to do in a greater measure,) tho afterwards the Preci∣pitate appeared white, like that made with ordinary Volatile Li∣quors of an Urinous Nature.
But because I expected that our Alcalisate Spirit of Blood, if I may Page  262 so call it, would have some peculiar Qualities, discriminating it from the Spirit drawn without addition; I thought fit to make a few Tryals with it, whose event justify'd my conjectures. For having put into a Glass Egg with a slender neck, some of our well rectify'd Spirit, it did not then afford any Volatile Salt in a dry form: (tho afterwards, if I mistook not, by another Tryal, we at length obtain'd a little) and ha∣ving continued the Tryal somewhat obstinately, we found the Spirit to have by the action of the Fire, lost its Limpidness, and to have been made muddy or troubled.
Having mingled another portion of it with a highly rectify'd, ardent Spirit, and kept them all night in the cold, no coagulation ensued, nor could we perceive any, after it had been kept divers hours in a mo∣derate heat. But the Mixture ac∣quired a Yellow colour, and let fall, somewhat to our surprize, a pretty Page  263 deal of darkish Powder, tho not enough to invite us to make any Tryals upon it.
We put to another parcel of our Spirit some good Spirit of Salt, but, tho they smok'd much at their meet∣ing, yet we observ'd no noise nor bub∣bles upon their commixture.
And having mingled another Portion with Oyl of Vitriol, tho there was produc'd a very great smoke, and besides that an intense degree of Heat, (the quantity of the matter considered,) yet there was no visible Ebullition, nor any noise or bubbles produc'd, but the colour of the Oyl of Vitriol was very much heightned, the mixture growing al∣most red.
From these, and the like Phaeno∣mena one may gather, that our Al∣calisate Spirit of Blood is in several things differing from the simple. Whether this disparity will make it a more potent Medicine, or make it, by too much participation of the Page  264 fiery parts of the Lime; a less safe Remedy, future Experience must discover. But it seems not impro∣bable, that either as a Medicine, or as a Menstruum, if not in both ca∣pacities, it may be a not Inconside∣rable Liquor. For which reason I have made my account of it the more Circumstantial.
Experiment II.
WE tooke ℥ij of Tartar Cal∣cined to whiteness by equal weight of (kindled) Nitre, and mingled this Alcaly with ℥ij of dry'd and powder'd Humane Blood. This mixture being distill'd in a Retort in a Sand Furnace, made it appear by its Productions, that Quicklime on these occasions acts otherwise upon the Blood than other Alcalies do. For, whereas the Distillation wherein Lime was employ'd, afforded us, as Page  265 has been noted, a Spirit that before Rectification was very strong, and unaccompanied with dry Salt; the Calcinatum of Nitre and Tartar af∣forded us at the very first Distillation, a Spirit less strong; but withal, so much Volatile Salt as cover'd almost all the inside of the Receiver, not now to mention the difference of their respective Caput Mortuums.) And tho the strong Saline Spirit of Blood made with Quicklime, did not, as we lately noted, make an Effer∣vescence with Acid Spirits, yet this Volatile Salt readily did it upon the affusion of Spirit of Salt.
Experiment III.
BEsides the fixt Alcalisate Addita∣ments, with which I distill'd the dry'd Blood of Men, I thought fit to add to it a very Acid Addita∣ment, viz. Oyl of Vitriol; and this Page  266 the rather, because I had long since found by Tryal, (and, if I misre∣member not, have elsewhere rela∣ted) that this Liquor being mix'd with some other Bodies, particular∣ly with some belonging to the Ani∣mal Kingdom, did in an odd manner mingle its own substances (for I take it not to be a simple body) with them, and notably diversify the Products of the Distillation. We put therefore upon ℥iij. of powder'd Humane Blood, an equal weight of Oyl of Vitriol, and left them for some time together, to try if by the action of this Corrosive Menstruum, tho upon a Body not of a Mineral Nature, some heat would not be ex∣cited, and accordingly we found, that after a while, tho not at the very first, the mixture grew sensibly warm. Then we removed the Re∣tort into a Sand Furnace, and distil∣ling it by degrees of Fire, we had a Spirit which was preceded by a pretty deal of Phlegmatick Liquor, Page  267 of an odd sulphureous smell, but so strong and lasting, that I could not but wonder at it. The Caput Mor∣tuum I was fain to let alone, because I had some Inducements to suppose, that it was of so compounded a na∣ture, that I should not in my present Circumstances have the opportunity to examine it throughly. But it seemed remarkable, that, notwith∣standing the great Acidity of Oyl of Vitriol, and the fixative power it exercises on many Bodies, where∣with it is committed to Distillation, our Experiment afforded us a pretty quantity of Volatile matter in the form of a white Salt. But indeed the smell and tast of it were so uncom∣mon, that I was troubled I had not then conveniency to examine it carefully; much less to try, whether it had any peculiar Vertues or Ope∣rations in Physick; tho I had then by me a Glass Instrument, that I purposely provided to obviate the great inconvenience that is usually Page  268 met with, and has been often com∣plain'd of by me as well as others, in the way Chymists are wont to imploy, when they are put to make repeated Sublimations of Volatile Salts, whether alone or with Addita∣ments of this Instrument I cannot now stay to give you an account, but if it continue to appear as use∣full as expeditious, I may hereafter do it by presenting you one ready made.
Experiment. I.
TO some Naturalists and Phy∣sicians that delight to frame Hypotheses, perhaps it may not be unwelcome to know, that for curio∣sities sake we attempted to make Aurum fulminans, by Precipitating a solution of Gold (made in Aqua Regia) with Spirit of Humane Blood, by dulcifying the Precipitate with Page  269 Common water, and then drying it leisurely and that by this means we succeeded in the attempt.
Experiment. II.
HAving into a wide-mouth'd glass put as much Spirit of Blood, as would more than cover the Ball of a small seal'd Weather-glass, and suffer'd this Instrument to stay a while, that the Ambient Liquor and the Included might be reduc'd to the same temper, as to Heat and Cold; we pour'd on some Spirit of Verdegreece made per se, and observ'd that, tho this Spirit with some other Volatile Saline Li∣quors, had a very differing operation, yet working on our Spirit of Blood, with which it made a conflict and excited Bubbles, there was produc'd in the Mixture a degree of Warmth, that was not insensible on the outside Page  270 of the glass, but was much more sensible in the Thermoscope, whose Liquor being hereby rarified, ascen∣ded to a considerable height above the former station, towards which when the conflict of the two Liquors was over, it began, tho but slowly, to return.
Experiment. III.
HAving by degrees mix'd our Spirit of Blood, with as much good Spirit of Nitre as it would manifestly work on, there was, not without noise, produc'd great store of Bubbles by their mutual conflict; which being kept in a quiet place, till after the Liquors had quite ceas∣ed to work on one another, it began to appear, that notwithstanding all our care to free the Spirit of Blood from Oyl, something of Oleaginous that had been concealed in it, had Page  271 been manifested, and partly separa∣ted, by this Operation; since not on∣ly a somewhat red Colour was pro∣duced by it, but after a while the surface of the Liquor was covered with a film, such as I have often ob∣served in Saline Liquors, copiously impregnated with Antimony or other Sulphureous Bodies. And this thin Membrane had its Superficies so dis∣posed, that looking upon it with Eyes placed Conveniently in reference to it and the Light, it did to me, and other Persons, that did not at all look on it from the same place, appear adorned with vivid Colours of the Rainbow, as Red, Yellow, Blew and Green; and as I remember, in the same order that these Colours are to be seen in the Clouds.
Page  272
Experiment. IV.
HAving unexpectedly found amongst some other long neglected Glasses, a Vial that was writ∣ten upon above twelve years before, and inscrib'd Spirit of Humane Blood, it appear'd to have been, by I know not what Accident, very loosely stopt: and yet not so, as to give me cause to think, that the Liquor was much wasted. But notwithstanding this, and that the Liquor had acqui∣red a deep Colour, almost like that of Red Wine; yet it was so dispirited and strengthless, that it appear'd to be very little other than nauseous Phlegm. Which Observation I therefore think not unworthy to be preserv'd, because by it we may guess, how little a portion of the noble and genuine Spirit or Salt, may suffice to make a Liquor pass for Spirit of Humane Blood.
Page  273
Experiment. V.
IN a Frosty season we expos'd late at night two or three spoonfulls by guess of Spirit of Humane Blood, that was not of the best, being at the utmost but moderately strong. And tho the Cold of that season had throughly frozen a Vial almost full of Oyl of Vitriol, and the night where∣in our Spirit was exposed, was (at least) moderately Frosty, yet the next morning we did not find so much as any Superficial Ice upon it. But having remov'd the Vial into a mixture of Powder'd Ice and Common Salt we found in no very long time, that most part of the Spi∣rit was turn'd into thin Plates of Ice, which joyn'd close together, and had their edges upwards, like those of the Leaves of a Book, when it is held with its back downwards.
Page  274
Experiment. VI.
TO make a further Tryal of that imperfect one mentioned in the Subordinate Title, we took a Clot of Humane Blood of the bigness of a Bean, or thereabouts, and having put it into a Vial in such manner, that that part, which before was contiguous to the Air, and for that reason, was florid, was now the undermost, and the other, which was blackish lay now uppermost, we made haste to pour upon it as much Spirit of Humane Blood, as was more than sufficient to cover it, and perceiv'd that the contact of it presently began to lessen the black∣ness of the surface of the Blood, and bring it to a considerable degree of Floridness; and to try whether that would continue, we stopt the Vial, and set it by till the next morning, Page  275 (for it was then night,) when look∣ing upon it, we found the Superfici∣al Colour not to be Black but still Red.
Experiment VII.
UPon the Powder of dry'd Hu∣mane Blood we put (in a small Vial) some of the rectify'd Spirit of Humane Blood, which quickly dissolv'd part of it, and acqui∣red a deep and pleasant Colour. But highly rectified Spirit of Wine, be∣ing put upon some of the same Pow∣der in a like glass, did not in many hours acquire any manifest Tincture, and got but a pale Yellow one, even after having been for a longer time kept in a moderate heat. And yet Common water, being put upon another portion of the same Pow∣der, did quickly enough appear, by the Colour it acquir'd, to have dis∣solv'd a pretty deal of it.
Page  276
Experiment VIII.
SOme of our Spirit of Humane Blood being put upon some curious Vitriol, that I had as a Rarity (if I mistake not) from the East In∣dies, part whereof was in lumps, and part beaten to Powder; that Li∣quor which was put upon the for∣mer, being able to dissolve it but slowly, made little or no Froth; but the Spirit that was put upon the lat∣ter, by hastily working on it pro∣duc'd a manifest one. And the Solu∣tions made of both parcels of Vitriol, were of a deeper and more lovely Blew, than the Mineral it self had been: nor did I observe in them any Precipitate of a dark Colour, as I have done upon the Mixture of Spi∣rit of Urine and Ordinary Vitriol.
Page  277
Experiment IX.
HAving with a clean Pen drawn some Letters upon white Paper with Spirit of Humane Blood, and as soon as 'twas dry, mov'd the unwritten side over the Flame of a Candle, we found that this Liquor may for a need be imployed, as an invisible Ink, that seemed to be some∣what better, than those formerly mentioned to have been afforded us by Serumand Urine.
Experiment X.
HAving found by Tryal that divers Salts, some that are Volatile and some that are not, being put in Powder into water, will whilst they are dissolving, sensibly refri∣gerate Page  278 it; and on the other side that some very subtil Spirits actually cold, being put into cold Water, will quickly produce in it a sensible warmth, I thought it would not be amiss to try, what Spirit of Humane Blood would do, when employed after the same man∣ner. Having therefore placed a seal∣ed Thermoscope in an open mouth∣ed glass, furnished with as much distilled water as would cover the Ball of the Instrument, we left it there for a while to bring the internal Li∣quor and the external to the same degree of Coldness. Then we pour∣ed upon the immersed Ball two or three spoonfuls of Spirit of Humane Blood (which was all we could spare for this Tryal) but perceived very little alteration to ensue in the Ther∣moscope, only that it seemed, the Spirit of Wine in the stem did a little, and but a very little, subside which effect (tho it had been much more manifest) I should not have been sur∣priz'd Page  279 at, partly because I found Spi∣rit of Urine to have a like, or some∣what more considerable effect, and partly because I remembred, what I elsewhere relate about the Operati∣on of the pure Salt of Humane Blood upon Distill'd Water; which Liquor I therefore make use of in these and many other Experiments, because in our common Pump-Water or Well-Water, and in most other common Waters, I have observed a kind of common Salt, which tho in very small quantity, makes it apt to coa∣gulate with, or precipitate, some kind of Saline Corpuscles, whether more simple, or more compounded. But before I quite dismiss the lately reci∣ted Experiment, I must acknowledge, that I dare not acquiesce in it. Since probably the effect of the Spirit of Blood would have been more consi∣derable, if I had been furnish'd with a sufficient quantity of it, to pour in∣to the Water.
Page  280
Experiment XI.
INto a slender Cylindrical Vial we put Filings of Copper, more than enough to cover the bottom, and then pouring on some Spirit of Humane Blood, till it reach'd about an Inch above the Filings, we stopt the Glass close, and, as we expect∣ed, the Menstruum dissolved some of the Metal, and acquired upon it a deep ceruleous colour, which by keeping the Vessel in a quiet place for some days, did by degrees disap∣pear, and left the Liquor like Water. And then the Glass being unstopt, there did, as was expected, appear a fine Blew surface on the confines of the Air and the Liquor, in a Mi∣nute of an hour or less; and this fine colour extending it self downwards, was in no long time diffus'd through the whole Body of Page  281 the Liquor; and that so plentifully, as to render it almost opacous. But, tho I kept the Glass many days after well stopt, yet (whether it were that there was too much Air left in the Vial, or for some other reason) the colour did not disappear, as was expected, but continued very intense. This may confirm and diversifie an Experiment related in the thirteenth Title of the Fourth Part of the Me∣moirs.
Experiment XII.
IT is not only upon Copper in its perfect Metalline form, but by Nature it self Embryonated in, or blended with stony matter, that our Spirit of Humane Blood did manifestly work: for having pour'd some upon well powdered Lapis Armenus, the Liquor did even in the cold, and in no long time, (for it Page  282 exceeded not a few hours) acquire a deep and lovely Blew, almost like the solution of Filings of Crude Cop∣per, made with the same Menstru∣um.
THE CONCLUSION.
ANd here, Sir, I shall at length dismiss a Subject, about which I now perceive I have already entertained you much longer than at first I imagined. And yet, if I pre∣vail with you, your trouble is not quite at an end; since I must exhort you to take the pains, for your own satisfaction and mine, to try over again such of the foregoing Experi∣ments, as you shall judge likely to Page  283 be of a contingent Nature. For, tho I hope you'l do me the right to be∣lieve, that I have as faithfully as plainly delivered Matters of Fact, without being biassed by Hypothe∣ses, or aiming at Elegance, yet my Exhortation may be reasonable. For I have observ'd Humane Blood to be a thing so diversifyable by vari∣ous Circumstances, and especially by the Habitual Constitution of the person that bleeds, and his present condition at the very time of Phle∣botomy, that I dare not undertake, that every repeater of the like Expe∣riments with mine, will always find the Events to be just such as I have recited mine to have had. Nay I dare not promise my self an exact uniformity of successes, even when I my self shall reiterate some (of the nicer) of my own Tryals; especial∣ly if I can do it, as I desire with greater Quantities of Blood than (for want of them) the first were made with.
Page  284To the Particulars already deli∣ver'd in order to the History of Hu∣mane Blood, I could now, Sir, add some others, if Time and Discretion would permit me to do it. For, as little cultivated as the Subject has been, I found it not so barren, but that, whilst I was delivering some Tryals concerning it, the considera∣tion of those, and of the Nature of the thing, suggested new ones to me. But 'tis high time I should break off an Appendix, that, being but a Rhapsody of the Notes and other things, that have occur'd to me since the Memoirs were written, may I fear, seem already too pro∣lixe, as well as confused. I do not forget, that the two last Subordinate Titles of the Fourth Part of the Me∣moirs, concern the External and Internal use of the Spirit of Blood in Physick; and that therefore per∣chance it may be expected, that I should here add some Experiments or Observations, relating to those Page  285 Titles. But I hope the lately men∣tioned Reasons, and my just back∣wardenss to part with some of them, because they are not yet finished, will make you easily excuse my lay∣ing them aside; which I am like to do long, unless you, and your Learn∣ed Friends shall peremptorily require them of me, in a fitter season than this; in which some occasions, that I cannot dispense with, call me off to other Employments, and oblige me to leave a further inquiry into this Subject to your self, and those able profess'd Physicians, who have, as well more Obligation, as more Abi∣lity than I, to pursue it effectually. This I may well hope that you and they will do, since upon a cursory review of a part only of what I have written, so many things sprang up even in my thoughts, as Original Tryals, if I may so call them, or as other things fit to be further consi∣der'd, that I perceived 'twould not be difficult to encrease the Appendix,Page  286 by two sorts of particulars; the one made up of designed Experiments, that is, such as have not yet been try'd, and yet seem worthy to be so, (to which 'tis probable our excellent Verulam would have given the Title of Historia Designata:) the other should consist of such Tryals as I call▪ Succedaneous Experiments, that is, such as I intended should be made upon the Blood of Beasts, in such Cases and Circumstances, wherein the Blood of Men, either cannot be had, or ought not to be procured. When I shall next have the happiness to converse with you, you may com∣mand a sight of what I have drawn up of this kind. And, if God shall please to vouchsafe me Health and Conve∣niency, I may perhaps (for I must not absolutely promise it) offer you what Addenda have occur'd to me, as things not unfit to make way for a more copious, and less unaccurate, Scheme of Titles, such as those that in the first part (of the Memoirs) are call'd Page  287Titles of the Second Classis, or Order: for which Scheme I was the rather invited to think it fit, Materials should be by some body provided, because second thoughts made me sensible that the Particulars compil'd in this small Book, come far short, (as I lately acknowledged, and you will easily believe,) of comprizing all that should and may be known of so noble and useful a Subject, as I have ventur'd to treat of. And I will freely confess to you on this occasion, that for my part, in the prospect I have of the future Ad∣vancement of Humane Knowledge, I think most of those Virtuosi that now live, must content themselves with the satisfaction, of having im∣ploy'd their Intellects on worthy Ob∣jects, and of having industriously en∣deavoured, by promoting useful Knowledge, to glorify God and serve Mankind. For I presume, that our enlightned Posterity will arrive at Page  288 such attainments, that the Discoveries and Performances, upon which the present Age most values it self, will appear so easy, or so inconsiderable to them, that they will be tempted to wonder, that things to them so obvious, should lye so long conceal'd to us, or be so much priz'd by us; whom they will perhaps look upon with some kind of disdainful Pity, unless they have either the equity to consider, as well the smalness of our helps, as that of our Attainments; or the generous gratitude to remember the Difficulties this Age surmounted, in breaking the Ice, and smoothing the way for them, and thereby con∣tributing to those Advantages, that have enabled them so much to sur∣pass us. And since I scruple not to say this of those shining Wits and happy inquirers, that illustrate and ennoble this learned Age, I hope you will not think that I, who own my self to be more fit to cele∣brate Page  289 than Rival them, would dis∣swade you from improving and sur∣passing the slight Performances, that are in this little Tract submit∣ted to your Judgment by,
Sir,
your very Humble Servant.
