THE PREFACE.
I Am far from being fond of their Practice, that affect to give pompous and promising Titles to their Books; in so much that my Friends have several times re∣proached me with inclining too much to the opposite Extream. But yet I am not averse from prefixing to the ensuing Paper, the Title of Medicina Hydrostatica; not only for the Conveniency of Citations, (which are usually troublesome to make in Tracts that have long Ti∣tles;) but because too I am Invited, if not Authorized to do it, by the Example of the famous and judici∣ous Sanctorius; who scrupled not to prefix the Name of Medicina Statica,Page  [unnumbered] to a Writing almost as Small, as 'tis Ingenious, which applys the Bal∣lance to Some Uses relating to the Medicinal Art, perhaps not More, than will be here found proposed of the same Instrument, improv'd by some Additions. And 'tis scarce to be doubted, but that in this In∣quisitive Age, the Sagacity of the Curious will make, both of what he has discovered, and of what I have delivered, useful Applications, that neither He, nor I, ever thought of.
If the chief thing, I aimed at in Writing, had been to gain Applause, I would have taken a more likely way to obtain it, than by treating of a Subject, wherein few will think themselves concerned, (tho' many in reallity be so, and whose Importance does not at first view appear.) And this Subject too, the Nature of it has obliged me, to treat of in such a way, that it will be almost as un∣pleasant to the Reader to peruse so unadorned a piece, as it was trou∣blesome to the Author to write so Page  [unnumbered] Toilesome an One. And indeed when I came to take notice of the Number of Particulars, that I had brought together into this little Book; I did my self somewhat won∣der, how I came to be prevailed with to lay out so much Pains upon so un∣inviting a Subject. But Knowledge and Health are two such valuable things, that I durst not refuse to un∣dergo, even a toilesome Task; whilst I was encouraged by the Hope, that was given me, that this kind of La∣bour may conduce somewhat to those desirable Ends; if not other∣ways, yet at least by exciting the more curious among Physicians, Chymists, and Others, to inlarge their Inquiries, and by helping them to remark divers things relating to Medicinal Bodies, that they are wont to overlook.
I had probably better consulted my Reputation, as well as my Ease, if, having contented my self with those few uncommon Notions, and Observations, that the rest of the Page  [unnumbered] Book was built upon; I had left the Applications made of them to par∣ticular Bodies, to the industry of Others. I shall not solicitously ex∣cuse my self, for not having bestow∣ed more Ornaments upon the fol∣lowing Essay; since the Nature of the Subject and Drift of the Writer, are sufficient to justifie the Plainness of my Style to the Judicious. I may have somewhat more cause to Apo∣logize for this; That I have not cast a Treatise about a Subject wherein Mechanicks are so much imployed, into the Form of Propositions; and given it a more Mathematical Dress. But I was unwilling by that means to discourage those many, who, when they meet with a Book, or Writ∣ing, wherein the Titles of Theoreme, Probleme,and other Terms of Art, are conspicuously placed, use to be frighted at them; and thinking them to be written only for Mathematical Readers, despair of understanding it, and therefore lay it aside, as not meant for the use of such, as they.
Page  [unnumbered]But there is another thing, upon whose score, I confess, I ought to wish for indulgent Readers. For the Papers compiled into this Essay, ha∣ving been written in loose Sheets, and at such distant times, that di∣vers Accidents interven'd between them; the loss of some of those Papers, as well as others of diffe∣rent Natures, and my want of Health, and Leisure, obliged me to change more than Once my propo∣sed design, and to imploy some∣times the Style of a private Letter, and sometimes again, that of a Discourse intended for the Pub∣lick; By which, means some Things, and some Expressions, that were suitable to the Design I had, when I committed them to Paper, became incongruous, when the Scope and Scheme of my Discourse were altered, especially Some parts of the Copy being out of my hands, when I should have adjusted the Others to them. But tho' these Irregularities may keep the parts of this Essay, Page  [unnumbered] from being so coherent as they should be; yet they will not prove very prejudicial to an intelligent Reader; who, finding the Matters of Fact, and the Notions, to be true, may, notwithstanding the want of an uniform Contexture, make good use of them.
Tho' divers little Memoirs and o∣ther things, that occured to me from time to time, whilst I was bring∣ing together the following Papers, have insensibly swelled them into a Book; yet the Essay it self was in my First intention, but a large Fragment of a greater work: where∣of an Account is given in the Letter to a Friend, (that is premis'd to a Paper annexed to the following Es∣say,) which (Letter) having been intended for a kind of Preface to the last Scheme of the whole larger work; if the Reader please to per∣use it, he will there find the Rise, and Scope of this little Tract, as well as of the other parts of that design∣ed Book; and some other things, Page  [unnumbered] that may make it needless to lengthen this Preamble by any thing more than two Advertisements. Of these, One is, that, being reduced by divers un∣expected, and unwelcome Accidents to forego my first design, and give on∣ly two or three Specimens of what was intended, and more than be∣gun; I made choice of the Title of the Chymical Changes of Bodies by Coloration, as a Sample of the Chymi∣cal part of the Treatise; and I pitcht upon the Subject of this present Es∣say, as a Specimen of the Mechanical part of the same Treatise; The o∣ther Advertisement, is, that the Rea∣der need not be startled, to find some little Variations of Specifick Gravity, among some of the Memoirs laid to∣gether in this Essay, because he will in due place be told,* why such things ought to be expected. And in the mean time, it may, I hope, suffice to say, that such Variations are nei∣ther new, nor easily avoidable things, in making Hydrostatical Experiments or others of Affinity to them. For Page  [unnumbered] Proof of which, to Readers, that, for want of having made Tryals them∣selves, may distrust what we have said, I shall produce a Couple of notable Testimonies. The first is given by so industrious and dili∣gent a Mathematician, as Mersennus himself. For he candidly acknow∣ledges, when he has occasion to mention some Tryals of the learned Ghetaldus,* and of the accurate French Engineer Monsieur Petit, & of his own; that the Variety of weighing, which often happens to amount to some Grains, is but like the Variety of As∣stronomical Observations; which do almost always differ in some Minutes or some Seconds. To which he soon after adds an Intimation, that shews, that he expected not an exact uni∣formity between the Observations of Ghetaldus, &c. already made, and the Tryals of an Experimenter, that would examine them by making the like again.
To this first Testimony we shall sub∣joyn the Second, which is, that our Page  [unnumbered] famous Experimenter, the Lord Ve∣rulam himself, writing of a Subject, that in several things has much Affi∣nity with ours, confesses, that 'tis not to be doubted, but that many of the Bodies, which he has set down in his Table of their Di∣mensions,* and Weights differ in the same Species or Denomination; some being heavier than others, and that therefore there is some Contin∣gency in this Affair, so that 'tis not necessary, that the Individuals he made his Tryals with should be exact Standards of the Nature of their respective Species, or should, (which makes directly to my present pur∣pose) agree altogether to a Title with Experiments of other Men.
But this scarce evitable Imperfe∣ction of Hydrostatical and the like Experiments does not hinder, but that by their help we may make good Estimates of the Weights, and Bulks, of very many Bodies; and among them of not a few that belong to two sorts of the three, that our Il∣lustrious Page  [unnumbered] Author acknowledges to be reducible to his Way of Mensura∣tion. And these Estimates will (if I mistake not) be found, not only pre∣ferable to those that can be made of the same Bodies by Geometrical In∣struments; but (which is more consi∣derable for the Reader) accurate enough to be very useful on a great Number and Variety of Occasions. Which last Clause, I purposely add to insinuate, that the Hydrostatical Way of Mensuration may be useful∣ly apply'd to several Bodies and Ca∣ses, that do not at all seem to relate to the Materia Medica, as would ap∣pear by inserting here what is deli∣vered about Metrical, and about Ex∣ploratory Experiments and Observati∣ons, in other Papers; if that were not too foreign to the ensuing Essay, as not belonging to the Subject, or to the Design of it.

CHAP. I.
I have, in a former Tract, endea∣vour'd (and, as I am told in Print, and otherwise, not altogether unsuccessfully) to make it proba∣ble, that divers, if not most, of the real Virtues (for many fabulous Ones have been ascrib'd to them) of Gems or precious Stones, may in great part proceed from the Qualities of Me∣talline and Mineral Substances, That, whilst the Matter was either fluid or soft, were (more or less plentiful∣ly) incorporated with the stony Mat∣ter, Page  2 which hardned afterwards into a Gem. The same Phoenomena and Reflections, that led me to the Opi∣nion newly recited, induced me to think it also very probable, that di∣vers Boles, Clayes, and other Earths, and, much more, that several Minerals; which, tho' not looked upon as Me∣talline Oars, and several Stones or sto∣ny Substances, that, by reason of their Bigness or Opacity, or perhaps un∣pleasant Colours, have been judged un∣worthy to be numbred among Gems or precious Stones, may yet be indow∣ed with considerable Medical Virtues; & perhaps with greater than the finer Gems themselves, because in these despised Stones and Minerals, there is often found a greater store of Me∣tallick and Mineral parts, which while they were in solutis Princi∣piis, as Chymists speak, might with ease plentifully insinuate themselves into these more open Bodies, where being setled they were not lockt up so fast and strongly, as in the noble• Gems; such as Diamonds, Rubies▪ Page  3 Saphirs, &c. which are of so Com∣pact, and as 'twere Glass-like, a Na∣ture, that divers Corrosive Liquors, and Aqua Fortis it self, are unable to penetrate and dissolve them; tho', as hereafter will appear, these infe∣riour Medical Stones, and other Mi∣nerals, may be opened by the like Menstruums.
Upon these Grounds, I thought it might be a thing of use to Physici∣ans, as well as to divers Mineralists and Mine-workers; if I imparted to them a Way of Exploring many Fos∣sils, that I do not remember I had met with, either among Physicians or Chymists: And tho' this Way of Exploration pretends not to disco∣ver directly more than one Quality of the Body examined by it; yet that Quality, being its specifick Gra∣vity, is so radical and considerable a one, that it may lead a Sagacious Enquirer further than at first sight one would think.
I considered then, that the most pure and homogeneous kind of Stones Page  4 we know of, and that seems the freest from all adventitious Mixtures, and even * TR's▪ is Rock-Chrystal: And therefore I pitched upon This, as the Standard I would imploy, to make Estimates of the greater or lesser re∣cess from Simplicity or Homogeneity of the Stones, or other Stone-like Substances, whose specifick Gravity I should examine.
We took then some Pieces of na∣tive Chrystal, clear and colourless, and having carefully weighed them first in the Air, and then in Water, we found, by Computation, that pure Chrystal was to clear Water of the same Bulk, as Two and an half, or thereabouts, are to One: So that, to clear the Matter by an Instance, if we suppose an hollow Cube, of Brass or other Metal, to be filled as carefully as may be, (for the upper Surface will scarce be exactly Level) with ℥j. of Water, and if afterwards the Cavity of the empty'd Vessel be ex∣actly filled with a Cubical piece of Rock Chrystal; this Stone will Page  5 weigh ℥ij and about an half. Some of my Tryals indeed, made with ten∣der Ballances, represented the Pro∣portion of these two Bodies, with some petty Variation. But besides, that 'tis not improbable, that diffe∣ring pieces of Rock Chrystal it self, tho' of equal Bulk, may not be pre∣cisely equal in Ponderosity; besides this, I say, the Variation I found from the newly assigned Proportion was so small, that having just intimated, that for the most part it rather sa∣voured a little the specifick Gravity of the Chrystal, than fell short of it; we may neglect it without any pre∣judice, worth taking notice of, to the Use that is to be made of this Pro∣portion in this Paper. And for as much as there may be some Scruple, tho' groundless, made about the Origin and Nature of Chrystal: I shall add, by way of Confirmation of what has been delivered, that I procured some strong Icicles, that had been fasten'd to Vaults, &c. as Bo∣dies that would be acknowledged to Page  6 be true Stones, and yet to have been in a Liquid Form; and having Hy∣drostatically examined these Concre∣tions, the specifick Gravity, tho' not exactly the same in all, appeared to be little differing from that of Chry∣stal; the solid Body exceeding the Weight of the fluid water, it Was Weigh'd in, about two times and an half, (a little more or less.)
*To apply this Fundamental Obser∣vation to the Uses designed in it, when I had a mind to make a proba∣ble Discovery, (for by this Way I pre∣tend to no more) whether in a Stone, or Stone-like Body propounded, the merely stony Matter were more or less commixt with some adventiti∣ous Substance of a Metalline Na∣ture, or that of some other Mineral more ponderous than Chrystal, I care∣fully weighed it: First in the Air, and then in the Water, according to the Method formerly declared, and if by Virtue of its specifick Gravity, its Proportion to Water of the same Bulk, exceeded the Proportion of five Page  7 to two (which to avoid Fractions, may be commodiously substituted to that often already mentioned of 2 1/• to one) I concluded it probable, that the Concretion had in it a Portion of adventitious Matter, heavier in Specie than Chrystal or mere Stone, by how much more or less the solid Body exceeded the Weight of Water equal to it in Bulk, by so much grea∣ter or lesser a Portion of Heteroge∣neous Matter was guest to be com∣mixed with the stony in the pro∣pounded Concrete. This may be illustrated, as well as proved, by the Examples that should presently fol∣low, but that it will be fit, before I descend to Particulars, to premise a Paper that concerns the whole De∣sign of this Tract.
CHAP. II.
THO' the Way of weighing So∣lids in Water hath been deli∣vered Page  8 by the ingenious Marinus Ghe∣taldus, and, out of him, by some few other Authors, and tho' therefore I might excusably dispense my self from delivering it distinctly: Yet since their Books are scarce, and the knowledge of this Way is almost every where supposed in these Pa∣pers, I hold it very fit, that it should once be proposed in this Tract, not only for that Reason, but for Two others. One, that a dextrous way of finding out the Weight of Bodies in Liquors, may be of far more use than Men seem to be yet aware of, being capable of being made, by a little Variation and Improvement, of good use to Naturalists, and even to Chymists. And the Other, that per∣haps you will find cause to think, that Experience and Reflections on it may have furnisht me with some few Expedients and Cautions for the bet∣ter Practice of this Art, and for the avoiding of some Errors, that may be very easily, and perhaps have been, run into, for want of the Cautions here given.
Page  9
The Way of weighing sinking Bodies in Water.
The Solid Body, given to be exa∣mined, is to be ty'd about with an Horse-hair of a competent length, which Hair at its other end is to be fastened to one of the Scales of a tender and exactly equilibrated Bal∣lance, so that, the proposed Body, be∣ing exactly weighed in the Air, and then immersed in a Glass or other fit Vessel, almost full of fair Water, may hang freely in that Liquor, be∣ing on every side encompassed by it. This done, you must put into the opposite Scale as many Weights▪ as serve to bring the Body hanging in the Water, to an exact Aequilibrium with the Counterpoize, and conse∣quently the Beam of the Ballance to an Horizontal Scituation. Then take out the Weights newly imployed, which give you the Weight of the Body in the Water, and deducting it from the Weight formerly taken of Page  10 the same Body in the Air, and by the remainder, which will be the diffe∣rence of these two, divide the whole Weight of the given Body in the Air, and the Quotient (whether consist∣ing of whole Numbers, or a Fraction, or both) will shew the Proportion, in specifick Gravity, between the examined Solid, and as much Water as is just equal to it in Bulk. To make this more easily intelligible by an Example; We took a fine piece of white Marble, (that Stone seem∣ing the most pure, and most free from Mineral Tinctures of any com∣mon opacous Stones) this being put into a good Ballance, whose Scales were well equilibrated, was found to weigh in the Air, ℥ij ʒiij ℈1. Grains IX. which, for Conveniency of Supputation, we reduce to 1169 Grains, then an Horse-hair was ty'd about this piece of Marble, and the other end of the same Hair was fa∣stened to one of the Scales, under which, at a convenient distance, was plac'd a somewhat deep Glass, almost Page  11 full of fair Water, in this Liquor the Stone was made to hang freely, be∣neath the Surface, and in the oppo∣site Scale, there were put Weights enough to bring it to an Aequilibriumwith the other, these Weights were found, being reduced to the former Denomination, to amount to 738. Grains, which gave us the Weight of the Marble in Water, (which was much less Weight than the for∣mer, because the Stone was partly sustained by the Water) this being substracted from the Weight of the same Stone in the Air, there remai∣ned 431. Grains, which gave us the Weight of as much as was equal to the Stone in Bulk. By this remainder the Weight of the Marble in the Air, viz. 1169 being divided, the Quotient was found to be 2 & 71/100, or near enough 7/10 for the Proportion in specifick Gra∣vity of White Marble to water. The Demonstration of this Practice is foun∣ded on what I have elsewhere given,* and it may, in another way, be found in some of the Commentators on Page  12Archimedes, de Insidentibus, humido.
For understanding of the Summa∣ry Direction newly given, it may be useful to subjoyn the following Notes: First, 'tis manifest by the Nature of the thing, that the Body, proposed to be weighed, ought to be heavy enough to sink in Water, since otherwise its Weight in that Liquor being none at all, cannot be signifi∣cantly deducted from its Weight in the Air; but if there be occasion to Weigh in Water a Body lighter in Specie than it, as Bees-wax, a piece of Firr-wood, &c. It may be done, tho' not without some trouble, by joyning to it a Body, heavy enough to make the Wax sink with it, but this Case belongs not to this place.
2. An Horse-hair is made choice of, for Hydrostatical Operations, be∣cause its said to be Equiponderant to so much Water; and tho' I have not found that to be strictly true, yet an Horse hair is fitter to be imployed in these Tryals, than any other string, I know of; and its specifick Weight Page  13 usually differs so little from That of Water, that the Difference may be safely enough neglected; and if the Solid proposed be too heavy to be sustained by a single Horse-hair, one may twist two, (or, if need be) more of them, to make the string strong enough to sustain the Solid.
3. I shall add, that I have met with Bodies, about which, by Rea∣son of their Roundness, as in Bullets, or of some other inconvenient Figure, we could not well fasten an Hair, or other string, wherewith to tye it to the Ballance. Now, on such occasions, I caused some Hairs to be so contex'd, as to make a kind of a little Hoop∣net, whose Meashes were not great enough to let the Body slip through them. In this small Vessel, whether you call it a Net or a Basket, which was ty'd by an Horse-hair (single or twisted) to one of the Scales, we put the solid Body to be weighed, and proceeded in the Operation, as if the Body were tyed but with a string.

But here it must be carefully noted once for all, that whensoever any Hydrostatical Tryal is made with an Horse-hair; there must be put in∣to the Scale that holds the Counter∣poize, as much of the same Hair, as can be guest to be of the same Weight with that part of the string that su∣stains the Body in the Water, which appears to be above the Surface of the Water; for this Liquor takes off the Weight only of as much of the Hair as is immers'd in it, so that the unimmers'd part of the string adds to the Weight of the Solid hanging in Water; and therefore, ought to be compensated by an equal Weight put into the opposite Scale.
5. When I kept a Ballance, only or chiefly, for Hydrostatical Tryals; I found it expedient, on divers occa∣sions, to take off one of the Scales with the strings belonging to it, and substitute in its room a piece of Lead, or other Metal of a Conical, or som other convenient, shape, exactly Equiponderant to the opposite Scale, Page  15 and at the same end of the string, to fasten one end of the Horse-hair that tyed the Body to be weighed in Wa∣ter. And sometimes also, when I did not take off one of the Scales, I caused it to be perforated in the middle, (yet, without lessening its Weight) that so the Body, to be im∣merst, might hang very Perpendi∣cularly from the midst of the Scale. The Motives, that induced me to these Practices, cannot be so well set down in few words; and therefore shall be now left unmentioned, especially because the Practices themselves, tho' on some occasions convenient, are not necessary.
6. There remain yet a couple of Remarks, which must less than any be pretermitted, if Men would avoid some Errors, that are but too often slipt into, by the Makers of Hydro∣statical Tryals. We are then (First,) to take notice, that the Body, to be examined, hang freely in the Water, so that no part of it any where touch the bottom or the sides of the Vessel, Page  16 or reach above the upper Surface of the Water contained in it; for, if any of these Circumstances be not taken care of, (as it happens, when we are not heedful enough) the true Weight of the Solid is somewhat altered; and if any Corner, or other part of the Body, (and the like may be said of the Horse-hair, 'tis tyed with) tho' but a small one, appear above the Surface of the Water: That extant Portion, being not at all sustained by the Li∣quor, adds (more or less) to the Weight, that the immerst Body should have. Care also must be had, that, as nothing but the Water do touch the hanging Body, so, no part of the Water may touch the Scale whence it hangs. I have several times obser∣ved, that immerst Bodies have been concluded to weigh more in the Wa∣ter than really they did; because, through such a want of Heedfulness, as is not uncommon, the Experi∣menters did not take notice, that if the string were too short, or the Vessel too full; the vibrating Moti∣ons Page  17 of the Ballance, would, at one time or other, carry down the Scale, the suspended Body was ty'd to, so low, as to make one part or other of it touch the Surface of the Water: some Drops of which Liquor would readily stick to it, and, because they adher'd to the nether part of it, would lye concealed from an Eye that was not prying, and by conse∣quence would sensibly add to the Weight of the Scale, and make the Body be thought heavier than indeed it was; which Over-sight must needs be very prejudicial, when one makes Experiments that require Exact∣ness.
7. But the most usual Cause of Mistakes i• Hydrostatical Tryals, (especially such, as are made on small Bodies) wherein a little Error may be greatly considerable, is this; that Men are wont to think it sufficient, (in these Tryals) that the Body to be examined, be totally immerst in the Water; whereas it does not only often, but most commonly happen, Page  18 that the given Solid, and the string that is tyed about it, carry down with them divers Particles of Air; and perhaps too, it may find and ex∣tricate others, that lay concealed in the Pores of the Liquor it self; which Aerial Particles fasten themselves to the little Asperities, that they meet with on the Surface of the immerst Bodies, in the form of Bubbles, which, like so many little Bladders full of Air, endeavour to buoy up the Body they adhere to▪ and on that account do, in Proportion to their Number and Bigness, lessen the Weight, which the immerst body would otherwise have in Water. And therefore, great care is to be had, especially in nic• Expe∣riments; that, by shaking the string, and warily knocking the Body a∣gainst the sides of the Glass, the ad∣hering Bubbles may be displaced, and emerge to the top of the Water▪ And I shall add a desire, that on some occasions this Caution be made use of more than once in the same Tryals; because I have several Page  19 times observed, that now & then after the immerst Body was freed from the first Bubbles that appear'd about it, o∣thers did succeed, before an end was made of weighing the Body; out of some of whose unperceived Cavities, or Pores, (whether superficial or lying deeper) perhaps the latent Air could not easily on a sudden be driven by the Water. I have been the more Circumstantial in explaining the summarily proposed Method of Weighing Bodies in Water, because Experience hath shewn, that 'tis not near so easie, as, upon the first reading of it, one would presume▪ to be ex∣act in the Practice of it.
Having obtained the Weight of a Body proposed; First, in the Air, and then in Water, according to the Me∣thod plainly delivered; 'twill not be difficult to discover Practically the Proportion in Weight, between the Solid and the Liquor. I say Practical∣ly, because the Rule is easie enough, tho' the Demonstration is not so rea∣dily to be understood by them, that Page  20 are not acquainted with the Prin∣ciples of the Hydrostaticks. The Theorem, upon which our Practice is grounded, was first, that we know of, delivered by the most sagacious Ar∣chimedes; whose Commentators have busied themselves in demonstrating it in a Mathematical way, as I have since endeavoured to do in a Physi∣cal way, and more easie to Natura∣lists in the Hydrostatical Paradoxes. Archimedes's Proposition is this, That a Body, heavier than Water, weighs less in Water than in the Air, by the Weight of as much Water as is equal to it in Bulk or Magnitude: Whence 'tis not diffi∣cult to deduce a Rule sufficing for our present purpose. For if you subtract the Weight of the Body proposed, whilst it is every way environed with Water; from the Weight of the same Body, which it was found to have in the Air; the residual Number or Diffe∣rence gives you the Weight (taken in the Air) of as much Water as is equal in Magnitude to the Solid pro∣posed; Page  21 so that, having now two Bo∣dies, one Firm, and the other Liquid, together with the Weight of each of them apart; to find their Proportion, you need but divide the greater by the lesser; and the Quotient compared to One, that is, to an Unite, will be the Antecedent the of the Proportion de∣sired between the solid Body and the Water; which is mentioned, but, as it is the Liquor that is generally im∣ployed in these Experiments, for otherwise the Rule will hold, mutatis mutandis, in other Liquors, as well as in Water.
CHAP. III.
ANd now having premised these Remarks, and thereby made way for the clearer Understanding of the subsequent part of this Paper; we shall proceed to the Examples, that this not unnecessary Digression has diverted us from propounding.
Page  22There is a deeply Red and Opa∣cous Mineral, that commonly passes in the Shops under the Name of La∣pis Haematites, tho' it seems to have more Affinity to that which divers Authors call Schystos. But whatever be the most proper Name that be∣longs to it, it is an hard Fossile, which, tho' little used by our English Physici∣ans, is in several Places abroad in great Request; & that not without cause, as far as I can judge, by what I yet know of it; and especially, for that Somni∣ferous Quality, that may be observed in some of its Preparations. But 'tis not here, tho' 'tis elsewhere, my Pur∣pose to deliver its Medicinal Virtues; but only to examine, whether, accor∣ding to our Method, it ought to be concluded to abound with Metallick Particles, (perhaps but Embryonated,) to whose Intermixture some of its Virtues may probably be ascrib'd. Therefore, in a very good Ballance, having weigh'd a piece of English Haematites, that chanced to amount to about ℥iij ʒij •/4, First, in the Air, Page  23 and then in Water; we found its Pro∣portion to this Liquor, as 4 15/100 to 1. At which Ponderosity, if I had not formerly made the like Experiments, I should have been surprized; as you probably will be, when you consider, that this Metalline Stone did not very much want of almost twice the Weight of a mere Stone of the same Bulk. This great Weight much con∣firmed me in the Conjecture I had made; that in this Lump was con∣tain'd a good deal of Metalline Sub∣stance. And this induced me (to add that upon the by) to examine my Guess, by subliming it, when finely powdered, and diligently mixt with an equal, or double, Weight of Salar∣monia•. For then having tasted, with the tip of my Tongue, of this Saffron-coloured Sublimate; I found it; as I expected, very Astringent or Styp∣tick, as divers Preparations of Mars are wont to be; and, for further Proof, having put less than a Grain of it in∣to a spoonful or two of good Infu∣sion of Galls; there was immediate∣ly Page  24 produced a Black, and as it 'twere Inky, Mixture.
Lapis Lazuli is sometimes made use of by Europaean Physicians, but more frequently by Arabian and o∣ther Eastern Ones, for divers purposes, but especially to make Evacuations by Vomit. This Emetick Faculty seem∣ed, likely enough, to belong to it up∣on the Score of a Metalline Ingre∣dient; and accordingly, having ex∣amined Hydrostatically, a piece that was judged moderately rich, we found the Proportion of it to an e∣qual Bulk of Water, to be as 3. to 1. which argues That, notwithstanding its briskness in Operation, it con∣tained a much lesser Proportion of Metalline Substance, than Lapis Hae∣matites, or divers less Operative Mi∣nerals.
*I elsewhere shew, that the Load∣stone may be applyed to Medicinal Uses, and that it emits Effluvia, that are not Magnetical, and may have sensible Operations upon the Body of Man. On which account, it was not Page  25 improper to examine it Hydrostati∣cally; by which means I found, that the Weight of a Lump of Loadstone, that I judged to be either English or Norwegian; was in Proportion to Wa∣ter of the same Magnitude, as 4 91/10• to 1. But of the specifick Gravities of Loadstones, much more may be met with in another Paper.
Lapis Calaminaris is often enough used in Physick, especially by Chy∣mists, to dry; and to imbibe Acidities. For which Uses, I prefer it before di∣vers more famous Drugs: But, tho' 'tis wont to be imployed, only as an ex∣ternal Remedy; yet some things, that I found in some uncommon Chy∣mical Preparations of it, made me think, it may deserve to be further examined and tryed. A famous and not unlearned Empyrick, to whom I willingly communicated some Pro∣cesses, that he desired of me; when I asked him about a Medicine, whose Success brought him a great number of Patients, for griping Fluxes, and some Dysenterical ones; candidly Page  26 discovered his Medicine to me, and solemnly assured me, it was nothing, but pure and well-ground Lapis Cala∣minaris, seasonably given in a just Dose; as in a fitter place I have more fully declared. This made it obvious for for me to conjecture, that Lapis Cala∣minaris participates of a Metallick Nature, as may be argued from its Operation upon Copper, which is thereby turned into Brass. Wherefore weighing a piece of this Fossile, first in Air, and then in Water, it appeared to be to this Liquor as 4 169/100 to 1.
If I had not among other Papers lost Some, wherein I had Registred a good Number of Tryals of this kind made upon differing Fossiles; 'twould be easie for me to add to the four already recited, others mani∣festly conducing to the same Purpose. But presuming, that those already delivered may at present suffice; I shall now subjoyn a few Observati∣ons, whereof the first may become the Candor and Impartiality of a Lover of Truth, and the rest inti∣mate Page  27 some further Uses of the Hy∣drostatical Way of exploring hard and ponderous Concretions, hitherto treated of.
I must not therefore forbear to ad∣monish you, that, tho' when an hard Fossile propounded, is found to be much heavier than Chrystal of the same Bulk; 'tis a very probable To∣ken, that in the Solid Concretion, there is a notable Portion, greater or lesser, of some Metalline or other ponderous Mineral Body, whence its good or evil Qualities, in reference to human Bodies, may probably be deduced; Yet, this hinders not, but that 'tis very possible, for a Fossile to be endowed with Medicinal Vir∣tues, or to have noxious Qualities, on the account of a Portion of ex∣traneous Matter; tho' its specifick Gravity doth but little exceed that of Chrystal, or the advantage seem but inconsiderable. For, (to pass by o∣ther Reflections) a very small Pro∣portion of Adventitious, Metalline, or Mineral, Substance, if it be of an Page  28 Operative Nature, may, in some Cases, suffice, to diffuse its self through the rest of the Mass, and impregnate it with active Qualities. Which may be partly Illustrated, and partly Proved, by some Experiments that will be hereafter met with, in one of the Chapters.
CHAP. IV.
*TO hint somewhat about the fur∣ther Utility of our Hydrostatical Way of Inquiry; I shall take notice in the first place, that it may assist us to guess, with probability, whether a Mineral Body propounded, as likely to be a Stone, or of a stony Nature, be so indeed. Thus Coral, for instance, is by some thought to be a Plant, by others a Lytho-dendron, but, by the greater Number, 'tis reckoned a∣mong Precious Stones. In this Dis∣sent of Opinions, the specifick Gra∣vity may be of considerable Use. Page  29 Wherefore, we thought fit to weigh a piece of choice and well colour∣ed red Coral; first, in the Air, and then in the Water, and found its Proportion to the Weight of as much of that Liquor, to be as 2 68/100 to 1. So that its specifick Gravity much favours their Opinion, who take it to be a Stone, since it not only e∣quals that of Chrystal, but some∣what exceeds it.
There are Some, that will have Pearls, because of their Hardness, and their being treated of by Jewelers, and others that write of Gems, to be of a stony Nature. Wherefore I thought fit examine their Pondero∣sity also. But not having now with me any Tryal of that kind; I shall sub∣stitute One that I made upon a mon∣strous Pearl, that was presented me by a Person that took it out of the Oyster. I call it Monstrous, because tho' it be well enough coloured, yet its Shape is irregular, and its Bigness extraordinary; as is also its Weight, amounting to full 206 Grains. This Page  30 being weigh'd in Water, its Propor∣tion in Gravity to an equal Bulk of the Liquor was found to be as 2 •1/•00 to 1. So that its specifick Weight was much about the same, with that of Chrystal.
There are Many, that take the Stones formed in Mens Bladders, for as true and genuine Stones, as Those that Nature forms in the greater World; and speak much, and some∣times not without ground, of the great Hardness of divers of them. But, tho' I deny not, that, in a laxer Sense, they may well enough pass for Stones; yet I should rather call them Animal Stones, than simply Stones; this Name having been constantly and generally used, to signifie Mineral or Fossile Stones: which, by our Way of Explora∣tion, may be easily distinguished from human Calculus's, and other like hard Concretions, found in the Bodies of some Animals. For, having examined a good Number of these Stones, I found, that not only the Chymical Analyses, I made of them, of which Page  31 I elsewhere give an Account, mani∣fested them, how hard soever they were, to be Concretions belonging to the Animal Kingdom, not the Mi∣neral: But, by an Hydrostatical Exa∣menof divers of them, I found them to differ much, in specifick Gravity, from true Fossile Stones. Of this you will, in its proper place, meet with several Instances; so that it may here suffice to mention Two, that now chance to come to hand. Namely, that a Calculus humanus weighing a∣bove ʒvjss was found to be in Propor∣tion to an equal Bulk of Water, as 1 76/100 to 1. And another, that weighed ʒiv and above an half, in the Air, being also weighed in Wa∣ter, appeared to be to this Liquor, as 1 69/100 to 1.
I mention these Stones as belonging to the Materia Medica, tho' they are lookt upon rather as Diseases, of which, indeed, they are very sad Pro∣ductions, because a famous and ex∣perienced Physician, that Practised long in the East-Indies, and had bet∣ter Page  32 Opportunity than almost any Eu∣ropean had before him, to try the Virtues of Bezoar, does either equal or prefer the Calculi, we are speaking of, even to Oriental Bezoar.
And to shew, that Men are not the only Animals, wherein Stone-like Concretions differ in specifick Gra∣vity, (and so may be distinguished, by that difference,) from Chrystal and such like true Stones; we shall sub∣joyn Two or Three Experiments, made upon choice Bezoar Stones, not exceeding a middle Size, such being the likeliest not to be adulterated. The first of these weighing in the Air ʒiij, and odd Grains, was found to be in Proportion to Water of the same Bulk, as 1 47/100 to 1. Another weighing somewhat less than ʒiij, was to the Weight of an equal Bulk of Water, as 1 53/100 to 1. I might add divers other Instances of the like Import; and tho I think them not necessary, yet I shall subjoyn One more, because 'tis afforded by a Be∣zoar stone, taken out of another of Page  33 the same kind: This Kernel-stone, if I may so call it, being Weighed in the Air wanted Nine Grains of ʒiij, and its Proportion to Water of the same Magnitude, was found to be as that of 1 55/100 to 1. In all which In∣stances, we may observe, that these Animal Stones not amounting to twice the Weight of Water equal to them in Bulk, have less of specifick Gravity, by above a Fifth part, than a true Fossile Stone (such as Chrystal) is wont to be endowed with.
CHAP. V.
THE Use lately proposed of our Hydrostatical Way of Ex∣ploration, suggests to me Another,* which may be deduced from it, as a kind of Corollary.
This comprehends two, somewhat differing, Ways of applying the Ob∣servations, we have lately mentioned. For first, we may by the Hydrosta∣ticks Page  34 be assisted to discover, with Probability, the resemblance, or the difference that may be between Bo∣dies of the same Denomination, so that some subordinate Species of them, may perhaps be distinguished, as well as several Individuals of the same, or lowermost, Species. Since, for Instance, we have found a nota∣ble difference between the specifick Weights of several Loadstones, that were dug up in several Countries or Mines; if greater Number and Va∣riety of Experiments, of this kind were made, we should possibly find, that, Caeteris paribus, the Loadstones of one Country, or of one Mine, are considerably heavier than Those of another; as, if I mistake not, I usu∣ally observed, the Norwegian and the EnglishLoadstones to be heavier in Specie, than Those that are said to come out of a warmer Region, Italy; whose Island of Elba abounds with Mines, whereof I saw one intire Mass, that I judged to weigh a great many hundred of Pounds. And this difference Page  35 of Weight between Fossiles of the same kind, when 'tis considerable, may be of good use to help us to di∣stinguish between the Stones of the same lowest Species, that are pro∣per to differing Countries or Mines▪ But, in Case the unequal Weight proceeds, as it often does, from an Adventitious Matter, that insinuated it self into the more genuine Matter of the Fossile, whilst 'twas Fluid or Soft, it may much assist us to guess at the greater or lesser Purity of Ho∣mogeneousness of the Fossile propo∣sed; which Discovery may, on di∣vers occasions, be of no small use to the Physician, the Jeweller, or the Naturalist.
CHAP. VI.
BUT the Second thing compri∣zed in our Corlolary,* may in divers Cases be of much greater Uti∣lity and Importance, as being very Page  36 proper to help us to discern genuine Stones, whether Animal or Mineral, from counterfeit Ones; which too often pass for true, to the great pre∣judice of Physicians and Patients, and the great Loss of Lapidarie's, and their Customers. For as there are few Qua∣lities appertaining to ponderable Bo∣dies here below, that are so radi∣cated, (if I may so speak) as their Ponderosity is. So there is scarce any Quality, wherein 'tis so difficult for Impostors, to make a notable Al∣teration unperceivedly, as the speci∣fick Gravity. I said, for Impostorsbecause, tho' in several Cases, 'tis not so very difficult, to alter the speci∣fick Weight belonging to this, or that, kind of Bodies; yet in those ve∣ry Cases, it may be exceeding diffi¦cult, and perhaps impractible, to make a considerable Change in tha• Quality, but by such Additions, o• Operations, as will make a sensible Change in some other Qualities too and thereby expose the Fallacy to b• discovered. And this will especiall•Page  37 prove difficult in many Cases to vul∣gar Cheats, and Counterfeiters, or Adulterators of Gems, and other va∣luable Minerals; because the little knowledge they have of the Nume∣rousness, and Variety, of Natural and Artificial Productions, confines them to a small Number and Diversity of Means, to accomplish their fradulent Designs. And whilst they are in∣tent, but upon counterfeiting the more obvious Qualities of things; and perhaps of eluding the known and vulgar Tryals Men are wont to acquiesce in; they are not like to take Care to maintain the specifick Gra∣vity, and secure their adulterated Wares, against an Hydrostatical Way of Examen, which, probably, they never so much as heard of. By this means, several Perls, for Instance, may be discovered to be Counter∣terfeit, without, in the least, injuring them. And I remember, That some factitious Corals, that, for Divertise∣ment, I made, to shew what might be done in that kind; were, notwith∣standing Page  38 their fine Colour, Shape, and Glossiness, easily discoverable, by their having a specifick Weight manifestly exceeding That, which be∣longs to natural Corals.
Before I knew better Ways, I have sometimes, for Recreation, by the help of Minium made Pastes, or factitious Gems, which, tho' transparent, and finely enough coloured, yet, because they contained some vitrified Lead, added to the other Ingredients to pro∣mote the Fusion, were liable to be de∣tected by an easie Hydrostatical Tryal of their Ponderosity. I have likewise seen a fair Bezoar Stone, that so re∣sembled a genuine Stone, That a great Price was set upon it. But be∣ing brought me to be judged of, I made little doubt of its being Coun∣terfeit, by reason of its appearing to me as heavy as a Mineral Stone of that Bulk; tho' the Possessor being loth to expose it to an uncommon Tryal, I could not so cogently evince, that I had a clear Reason to disadvise the purchase of it.
Page  39
CHAP. VII.
AFter these Instances, (which are not the only,* that might be al∣ledged of this kind) the affinity of the Subjects invites me to take notice of another Use, or, at least, a Varia∣tion of the former, which may be made of our Hydrostatical Way of examining Solids. For it may, on di∣vers occasions, assist us, to make pro∣bable Estimates of the Genuineness, or the degree of Purity of several Bo∣dies, that are, or may, usefully be imployed in Physick; tho' they be not Stones or Minerals, provided they be heavy enough to sink in Water. For when we have once found the specifick Gravity of a Concretion of this sort, that we know to be Ge∣nuine, and well-conditioned in its kind; this degree of Ponderousness may serve us for a kind of Standard, Page  40 whereby to judge of others, of the same Denomination, or that are said to be of a like Nature.
To illustrate a Remark, that has no more of Difficulty in it than This, fewer Instances will suffice, (if any be necessary) than you will meet with in the following Part of this Tract, wherein they will opportune∣ly occur. And therefore, instead of setting them down in this place, I choose to give you an Advertisement, that would surprize you, if I had not formerly hinted somewhat, applia∣ble to the same purpose, by no great Variation. For that which I am a∣bout to observe to you, is, That, I think, there should be made a great difference between the Estimate, that Men make of some Stones, to which the Shops give the Name of Gems, according as the Estimate is to be made by Jewellers and Goldsmiths, or by Physicians and Chymists. For the Tradesmen, who usually aim but at the Beauty and Lustre of the Gems they would Sell, may justly esteem Page  41 those Caeteris paribus the best, that are in Specie the lightest, because such are generally more uniform as to Sense, and more Transparent; and also, receive their Colour from Pig∣ments of finer Parts. But, on the con∣trary, those, that in Gems seek main∣ly, if not only, for the Medicinal Vir∣tues; may justly value Those most, that are most Ponderous: as having more plentiful Portions of the Me∣tallick, or Mineral, Substances, whence the greatest part of their Virtues is, as has been formerly no∣ted, in Probability, to be derived. And this difference in specifick Weight, in Stones that have the same Name given them, I sometimes found to be far greater, than one that has not try'd it would imagine, as may ap∣pear by some Instances, applicable to this Argument, that will hereafter be met with. But yet, I would not hence infer, that even such Stones, whether transparent or not, as ap∣pear fine, and are but light in their kind, must be devoid of Particles, Page  42 whether Metalline, or of kin to them, whence they may be endowed with considerable Medicinal Virtues. For there are Mineral Pigments of so sub∣tle a Nature, that so small a Quantity as will scarce make them sensibly heavier than Gems that are less, or perhaps not at all coloured, may be diffused through the whole Matter; and, at least, impregnate every sensible part of it: This I shall Illustrate by the following Experiment, devised for that purpose.
Five Grains of powdered Zaphora, being mixed with ℥j ʒss of finely powdered Venice Glass, and kept a full hour in Fusion in a Furnace, that gives an exceeding violent Fire, af∣forded a transparent Mass, that was throughout of a fine blew Colour, and that deep enough; so that one part of the Pigment sufficed to tinge, by Fusion, above an hundred parts of the Glass: And when for Curiosity, we made the Proportion of the Za∣phora a little greater, taking Eight Grains of the Pigment to ℥j of Glass, Page  43 that is, One to sixty; the Mixture ha∣ving been kept for the like time in strong Fusion, the Mass was so deeply coloured, that the Proportion of the Tinging stuffe to the rest of the Wa∣ter, appeared too great to make a handsome Gem.
And further to manifest, that a Quantity of Metalline Matter, tho' it be but very small, may suffice to give a Tincture, and so to impart a Virtue to a Glassy Body, and even to Gems; I shall add an Experiment, that perhaps you will think somewhat strange. I had long conjectur'd, that there was in Granats, especially in some that were deeply coloured, pret∣ty store of Metalline Corpuscles of a Martial Nature, and that those Cor∣puscles are more than sufficient for the Granate it self, into whose Composi∣tion they enter, tho' not visibly, be∣cause of their extream Minuteness. Up∣on this supposition, I took a Bohemian, or rather German, Granate, (for I never saw any Bohemian so large) that I had kept by me for a Rarity, because Page  44 of its Bigness and deep Colour, tho it was not a fine Stone to look on, notwithstanding its being transpa∣rent in those Edges that were thin. This being reduced to very fine Pow∣der (but not in an Iron Mortar, lest should take somthing from the Metal) we exactly mixt Eight Grains with an Ounce of finely pulverized Chrystal∣line Glass; afterwards the Mixture was kept two hours in a Furnace, that gives a stronger Fire than ordinary VVind-Furnaces, by which means we obtained, as I expected, a pretty uni∣form Mass tinged of a sufficiently green Colour, such as prepared Iron, or Steel, gives to pure Glass.
CHAP. VIII.
WHat has been hitherto deli∣vered, may serve to shew, in some measure, the Uses of our Hydrostatical Way of examining Drugs, upon a Supposition that they are Solid, and neither very minute, nor too light to sink in Water. But I must not forbear to confess, and even Page  45 give Notice, that there are many Simples, and other ponderable Sub∣stances, that may, upon good Grounds, be said to belong to the Materia Me∣dica; which yet want One, or More, of the newly expressed Conditions. Wherefore I must not conceal, that there are Three things, which, tho' not necessary to the Understanding of the Usefulness of the foregoing Part of this Discourse; may, if they can be performed, much conduce to Facilitate (for I dare not say, to Com∣pleat) the Hydrostatical Way of exa∣mining Bodies, heavier in Specie than Water. And therefore, tho' I con∣fess it no easie Task to surmount the Difficulties to be met with in this Attempt; yet I shall endeavour to lessen them as much as I can, by offer∣ing to you the Expedients, that I was wont formerly to make use of in the Three Cases, I am about to mention: Namely, First, When the Body to be examined was Liquid, and conse∣quently, I could not be immediately taken hold of by an Horse-hair, or Page  46 any other slender String. Secondly, When the Body proposed was either in the Form of Powder, or consisted of Fragments that were so small, that it 'twas not possible, or, at least, not fit, to fasten each of them to an Hair; and suspend it after the manner of a Body of a greater Bulk. And, Thirdly, When the Solid to be Hy∣drostatically examined, though great enough in Bulk to be tyed about, was dissoluble in Water; and consequent¦ly unfit to be weighed in that Medi∣um: Since therein its Gravity must continually decrease, whilst the Ope∣ration was performing.
As to the First of the Three Diffi∣culties; lately mentioned, I suppose, I need not solicitously premise, that the Liquid Substance, to be Hydro∣statically examin'd, ought to be heavier in Specie, than the Water, or other Fluid, 'tis to be weighed in; and of such a Nature, as not to be apt (at least, speedily) to mingle it self with it: since, otherwise, the pro∣posed Liquor will either emerge in Page  47 that it should be weighed in, or else be confounded with it, and so re∣tain no distinct Mass, or Gravity.
Supposing then, that the Liquor, to be examined, has belonging to it the Two newly recited Conditions, we made use of this Expedient to explore its specifick Weight. We took a small Jar, or wide-mouthed Glass capable of containing an Ounce or two of common Water, and weigh∣ing in the Air about, Three or four Drams (more or less, as occasion re∣quires.) This Glass, which▪ for Bre∣vities sake, we are wont to call Hy∣drostatical, or else Glass-Bucket; we weigh very carefully once for all, first in the Air, and then in the Wa∣ter, and by the difference of the Weights we find, according to the known Hydrostatical Method, a Weight equivalent to That of the Substance of the Glass in Water is so that such a Weight being put into the opposite Scale of the Ballance, the Vessel hanging under the Sur∣•ace of the Water, may be consi¦dered Page  48 as having no Weight at all, that is, no Praeponderancy. And con∣sequently, the Weight of a Body contained in this Bucket may be looked upon, as That of the Body it self in Water, without being increa∣sed by that of the Vessel; so that, in our Instance, the Bucket makes a Mass of Quick-silver, tho' Fluid, as ponderable as if 'twere coagulated into a Solid Body.
The Glass-Bucket being thus pro∣vided once for all, we put the propo∣sed Mercury into it, and weigh them together in the Air; whence dedu∣cting the already known Weight of the Vessel it self in the Air, the Re∣sidue gives the Weight of the Quick-silver alone in the Air. This done, by the help of an Horse-hair, we tye the Bucket to one of the Scales, (or to either end of the Beam,) and letting it, with the Quick-silver in it, slowly sink into a Glass, or other Vessel, competently full of fair Water, and hang so, that the Bucket may not any where touch, Page  49 either the bottom, or the sides of the larger Vessel; we reduce by Weights, put into the opposite Scale, and ad∣ded to the formerly mentioned Coun∣terpoise of the Bucket in the Water, the Ballance to an exact Aequilibrium, without raising the Bucket quite to the Surface of the Water; this new∣ly obtained Weight, of the immerst Quick-silver, being deducted from its Weight in the Air, 'tis easie, by the known Hydrostatical Method, to obtain the Proportion in Gravity, be∣tween the given Mercury, and an equal Bulk of Water.
To expedite this Operation, it may be convenient to have in rea∣diness (as I was wont to do,) a couple of Weights, of Lead, or Tin; the greater exactly equal to the Weight of the Glass-Bucket in the Air, and the other equal to the Weight of the same Bucket in Water. For, by keep∣ing these two Weights constantly in readiness, One has at hand a Coun∣terpoise of the Vessel, in which soe∣ver of the two Medium's 'tis employ'd Page  50 in; which saves them, that have fre∣quent occasion to use the Ballance, much of the time that must other∣wise be spent to adjust it.
This Advertisement being premi∣sed, the lately propounded Operation will be best understood by an Exam∣ple; we took a small Glass-Jar capa∣ble of holding about ℥ss. of Water, and put it into one Scale of a ten∣der Ballance; whose other Scale we furnisht with a Counterpoise, or Weight, equal to the Glass. Into this little Vessel, we then put ℥ 1, that is, Four hundred and eighty Grains of Mercury (affirm'd to be Spanish, which is counted the richest) and the Glass with this Mercury in it was, by an Horse-hair, made to hang from one of the Scales, into a deep Glass Vessel of Water. Whilst it wa• in that state, there was in the op∣posite Scale a Counterpoise to the Glass it self in the Water, so tha• the Drams and Grains, that 'twas re∣quisite to add, gave us the Weigh• of the Quick-silver only, the Weigh•Page  51 of the Glass, being already accoun∣ted for. But Care was first taken, that the open-mouth'd Vessel should be every where environed with Wa∣ter, and diligently freed from adhe∣rent Bubbles; and that a piece of Horse-hair should be added to the Counterpoise, to compensate that part of the String or Hair tyed a∣bout the Bucket, that was in the Air, intercepted between the Scale, it was fastened to, and the Surface of the Water. By this means, we found the Weight of the Quick-silver in that Liquor, to amount to 446 Grains, which being substracted from the Weight of the Quick-silver in the Air, the difference was 34 Grains, by which the greater Num∣ber being divided, the Quotient was 14 and about 1/1•. So that the Mer∣cury, imploy'd in this Operation, ap∣peared to be in Gravity to Water of the same Bulk, as 14 11/••• to 1. I said, the Mercury imployed in this Opera∣tion, because, in former Tryals, I scarce found common Quick-silver, Page  52 that was bought in Shops, to weigh full Fourteen times, and sometimes scarce 13 and ½ as much as a Bulk of Water equal to it; whether the Ponderousness of our last used Mer∣cury proceeded from hence; that, as some Chymists extol Spanish Mercu∣ry, as participating more than o∣thers of a Golden Nature, (which O∣pinion, a Tryal, that I purposely made of That imploy'd about the late Experiment, did not disfavour;) So, there was in this of Ours some∣thing of unfixt Gold, that some∣what increased its Weight; I leave to further Enquiry.
If you can command, as I can∣not, the Learned Ghetaldus's Archi∣medes Promo•us: Since, as I am in∣formed, He there sets down the in∣tensive Weight of Quick-silver Hy∣drostatically found; it may be worth your while to consult that scarce Book, and compare the things you may meet with there, relating to Quick-silver, with what I have now delivered. To which I shall add, Page  53 That this I may here give you No∣tice of in general; That, having on Chymical and other Accounts, had more occasion than most Men, to make Tryals of this sort, I did not find all running Mercuries, tho' they did not appear adulterated, to be pre∣cisely of the same Weight: Nay, even destilled Mercuries, if once combin'd with Metalline Bodies, and particularly, if they were animated, and drawn from fine Gold; I found to differ more from common Mercu∣ries sold in Shops, than These did from one another; and even between common Mercuries, notwithstand∣ing their having been Destilled, we found a notable Disparity. But to inlarge on this Subject, were impro∣per in this Place, where I mentioned the Weight of Mercury: But to give so clear (tho' but single) an Instance of the Way of measuring the Weight of ponderous Liquid Bodies in Water, as may warrant me to say; That, by this Method, tho' not always with the same ease, we may explore the spe∣cifick Page  54 Weight of other Liquors, that are in equal Bulk heavier than Water, and yet are indisposed to mingle with it; such as are the Chymical Oyls of Cinnamon, Cloves, Guajacum, &c. But the chief thing, that has made me the the more Circumstantial in deliver∣ing the foregoing Experiment, was, that this practical Direction, for weighing one Liquor in another, will hereafter appear to be applia∣ble to useful Purposes, especially when we come to mention, in the following Chapters, several Cases, wherein Liquors of a Nature very different from Water, may be substitu∣ted in its stead.
CHAP. IX.
AS for the Way of Examining Hydrostatically the Powders of sinking Bodies, such as Minium, Put∣tie, &c. or such small Solids, or Frag∣ments of greater Ones, as by reason Page  55 of their Littleness or inconvenient Shape, are singly unfit to be tyed with an Horse-hair to the Ballance; as the Fragments of Rubies, and other pre∣cious Stones, wont to be sold by Weight at the Drugsters or Apothe∣caries Shops: the Way of discovering the Weight of these in Water, dif∣fers not much from That lately de∣livered of weighing Quick-silver in that Liquor. For on these occasions also, we imploy such a Glass-Bucket, as was lately described; and having made it very dry, as well within, as without; We put into it the Metal∣line Calx, or other heavy Powder, or a convenient Quantity of the Frag∣ments of Gems, or a competent Number of small, tho' intire, Bodies, as Pieces of Native Cinnabar, Seed-pearl, &c.and proceed with these, as we did with Quick-silver. Only this Caution is to be heedfully taken along, that we warily, and little by little, put into the Bucket, whilst 'tis yet kept in the Air, and hath the already weighed Powder, or Frag∣ments Page  56 in it, a convenient Quantity of the same Water, 'tis to be weighed in; that the Liquor may have time to insinuate it self between the dry Bodies, and even the Corpuscles of the Powders, and expel thence the Air, that was harbored in the Intervals betwixt them; which little Aerial Portions, if not thus seasonably ex∣pelled, would, upon the immersion of the Vessel, produce in the Water store of Bubbles, that would buoy up, or fasten themselves to the Fragments, or other small Bodies, and make the Ex∣periment uncertain, or fallacious. And if it be a Powder, that is to be weighed; unless it be before hand throughly wetted, and thereby freed from Aerial Particles, and reduced to a kind of Mud; there is Danger, that some dry Corpuscles of the Powder, will, when the Vessel is under Wa∣ter, be buoy'd up, and get out of it, and, floating on the Surface of the incumbent Water, take off from the true Weight, that the immerst Pow∣der should have in that Liquor.
Page  57If this Way of examining Bodies be carefully imployed by a dextrous Man, furnished with a tender Bal∣lance, it may be of considerable use, not only to Physicians, Druggists, and Apothecaries, that are conver∣sant with the more precious Kinds of sinking Bodies, that belong to the Materia Medica; but also to Lapida∣ries, and Gold-smiths, whom it much concerns not to be imposed upon by counterfeit Gems, or by other Stones of price, that are not duly conditi∣oned, in their kind. Thus the Frag∣ments of the Five precious Stones, That (upon what grounds, I now inquire not,) are made Ingredients of some Noble Compositions, as Con∣fectio Hyacinthi, &c. these Fragments, I say, may each sort of them apart be usefully examined by their Weight in Water, by him that knows the true specifick Gravity of a parcel of the finest, or else of such as he jud∣ges to be fittest for his purpose. And, to add That upon the By, whereas Granates are reckoned among the Page  58 Five Medicinal precious Stones, and in some Pharmacopoea's are preferr'd to the First place, as the best: I have found so great a difference, in point of Ponderosity, between European Granates and American Ones, whereof some were sent me as a Present from New England, and others, I my self pickt plentifully enough out of an odd American Mineral, that I suspe∣cted to contain them; that it was very obvious to think, their Virtues might be very different, if not as to Kind, yet, at least, as to Degrees: And not only such factitious Pearls as have delu∣ded many, and sometimes even fa∣mous, Jewellers, (as one of themselves, that was Lapidary to a great Mo∣narch, confessed to me) may often∣times by this Expedient be disco∣vered, especially if Mercury (tho' disguis'd) be imploy'd in making them; but, we may probably by the same Method discriminate the natu∣ral Pearls of several Countries and Sorts, whereof I have seen a far grea∣ter difference than one would expect; Page  59 and I have somewhere yet by me na∣tural Pearls of such various Colours, as well as Shapes, as have somewhat surprized even the Curious. But because it more concerns Physicians and Patients, to be able to make Esti∣mates of Seed Pearl, that are on ma∣ny occasions of good use to health; than to know the Genuineness of those bigger Ones, that are seldom made use of, but for Ornament; I shall here mention the result of an Experiment, which I find among my old Notes, to have been made by me, when I was furnished with very fine Oriental Seed-Pearls. For having examined these by the Way, we are now discoursing of, as judging them Orient enough to be fit to be Pat∣terns, wherewith to compare Others; we found these to Water of the same Bulk, 2 75/100 (i. e. ¾) to 1.
But in This, and in those other Tryals, whose Difficulty, or Impor∣tance, require, that we make them as exactly, as we are able. I must advertise you, that 'tis not fit to trust Page  60 to the Steddiness of your hand, in holding the Ballance, but that you make use of a Gibbet, (as they call it,) or some other stable Prop to sup∣port it. For the Hand often shakes, and makes the Instrument that it holds, to do so: and oftner grows weary before the Scales have had time to play up and down, and at length settle in a determinate Scituation; wherein if you miss of a true Aequi∣librium, the Hand must undergo a new Pennance: Whereas, when the Ballance hangs on a stable Fulcrum, you have both your Hands to help you, and need not be tempted by Weariness to desist, before the Bal∣lance be brought to rest in a per∣fect Aequilibrium. The Neglect or Omission of this Practice, I take to be one main Reason, (for the want of good Ballances, or of Skill to use them, is oftentimes Another) why so many of the Experiments, that re∣quire weighing, are Erroneous; as they that cautiously examine them (as I have sometimes had occasion to Page  61 do) may easily find. And therefore, (to add That, upon the By,) I hope, you will not make haste to censure the Accounts I give of Hydrostatical Tryals, because they do not always agree with Those of other Mens; since perhaps they did not imploy, either more Diligence, or better Instru∣ments, than I.
CHAP. X.
THe last of the Three Cases, for∣merly mentioned: Namely, What is to be done, when the Body to be Hydrostatically examined, will dis∣solve in Water, or easily mingle with it?Imports a Question, difficult and trou∣blesome enough to be resolved. Nor can this Examen be performed by a single Operation, which yet sufficed in each of the Two foregoing Cases. And having seriously considered the Matter, the best Expedient I could then think of was, That, which di∣vers Page  62 years ago, I propounded in an Assembly of the Royal Society, and grounded on this Reflection, That tho' the Body proposed could not be immediately weighed in Water, yet we may substitute another Liquor that will not dissolve it, and there∣by investigate the specifick Gravity, in reference to that Medium; and then, by comparing the difference of those Two Liquors in point of Gra∣vity, One may come to discover, What the Body proposed would have weighed in Water, in case it could have been kept there a competent time, without having any part of it dissolved. Considering then, that, except Quick-silver, the visible Fluids we can command, are either of an Aqueous, or of an Oily, Nature; and that most Bodies, whereof we can make Solutions in Liquors of the for∣mer, will not (at least, sensibly) suf∣fer themselves to be dissolved by those of the later, Kind, whilst a pro∣posed Solid is weighing in them: We presum'd that the most Saline Bodies, Page  63 such as Allum, Vitriol, Sal Gem, to which may be added, Borax, Subli∣mate, &c. might be commodiously weighed in Oleous Liquors. Among these I made choice of Oil of Tur∣pentine, rather than Oil-Olive, or any Chymical Essential Oil: Partly, because, being of common use, 'tis to be procured in sufficient Quantity, and, being very cheap, is seldom a∣dulterated, as Chymical Oils are too often found to be; and, partly, be∣cause being a distilled Body, it may be presumed to be free from Aqueous Parts, of which Experience has shewn me, that common expressed Oil is far from being destitute: But because Two Liquors, that are indeed both of them Oils, are wont to have distinct Names given them in the Shops; I shall here intimate, that I do not, when I have my Choice, make use of that which many call the Oil of Turpentine, but of That which first comes over, which those that distinguish them, call the Spirit of Turpentine: I prefer This, Page  64 (I say,) because 'tis clear, almost like fair Water; whereas, That which is called the Oil, besides that 'tis less Fluid, is commonly of a Yellow Colour, which does lessen its Transparency, and may be compounded with some of the coloured Bodies to be weighed in it.
There are many Persons, that would find it very difficult, and to whom, on most occasions, 'twill not be necessary, to know the determinate Proportion in Gravity, between Oil of Turpentine, and the Solid that is weighed in it; and to discover, by the help of that Gravity, what the Bo∣dy proposed would weigh in Water, in case it could be kept for a com∣petent time in that Medium, with∣out having any part of it dissolved therein. And therefore, Tho', if you desire it, I shall, God permitting, an∣nex the Method of performing this Task (which, you know, requires more Calculation, than every com∣mon Reader is able to go thorow with) to the end of this Tract: Yet,Page  65 for the present it may perhaps be suffi∣cient, as well as fit, that I give you notice, that those, that have not Skill enough to determine, by the Hydro∣staticks, the Proportion between sink∣ing Solids, and the Liquor they are weighed in, may yet be assisted by what we have delivered about Oil of Turpentine, to make a not unuse∣ful Estimate, What is the specifick Gravity of divers Bodies, in reference to others of the same, or a differing, Species; and by that means, to make a probable Guess, Whether or no it be rightly Conditioned; if he be but provided with one piece of the Body, which he knows to be Genuine or well qualified. For This may serve him as a Standard, whereby to exa∣mine other Bodies of the same De∣nomination, that he may have occa∣sion to Purchase, or to Sell, or to Imploy. As, suppose a Trades-man be to buy a parcel of Sublimate, he may take an Ounce, for instance, or half an Ounce of some of That he knows to be good or rightly made: Then having Page  66 carefully weighed it in Oil of Turpen∣tine, and set down how much it weighs therein; if he takes an Ounce, or half an Ounce of the Sub∣limate, he would make Tryal of, he may weigh that, as he did the other, in the same Liquor, wherein if it give the same Weight with the Standard, 'tis a good Sign; but if it weighs not so much, 'tis a Sign that it has not its full or due Proportion of Mercury, and too great a Proportion of Salts, whence its comparative Lightness proceeds. The same Way of trying may be made use of, for the Examen of Mercurius Dulcis, and divers other Bodies, totally or partly, dissoluble in Water, as of Allum, which is often Sophisticated with some baser Salt; and of Roman Vitriol, which is sometimes either counter∣feited, or adulterated by the help of Roch All•m, and a Tincture of Copper. And according as the Weight in Oyl of the Body proposed, recedes more or less from the Weight of the Stan∣dard, so the Adulteration may be probably concluded to be lesser or greater.

CHAP. XI.
BEfore I go off from this Subject, 'tis fit that I give you notice, that the Hydrostaticks may supply us with another Way of Estimating the intensive Gravity of Bodies, Solid or Fluid, that may on some occasi∣ons be of good use. The Way I mean is this; we take a solid Body more than heavy enough to sink in Water, and carefully observe, once for all, its Weight in the Air; then we weigh the self same Solid, first in One of the Liquors we would examine, and then in another; and so onwards, if there be more than two: And having noted the diffe∣rence between the Solid, and each of the Liquors, 'tis easie to find, ac∣cording to the Practice elsewhere delivered, the specifick Weight of each, and the Proportions betwixt Page  68 them. And in regard 'tis but One and the same Solid, that is compar'd to the differing Liquors; whatso∣ever their Number be, it will not be difficult, to compare the speci∣fick Gravities of those Liquors be∣twixt themselves, and to discover by the Weight of the First, That of any of the Others that One pleases.
The propos'd Way having been but Summarily delivered, it will not be amiss to subjoyn some Re∣marks relating to it.
And First, If you intend to im∣ploy but One Solid in your Examen of Liquors, 'twill be necessary you make Choice of such an one, as hath a much greater specifick Gravity, than is necessary to make it sink in Wa∣ter. For there are some Liquor• that are far, perhaps twice, more ponderous than This newly named. Secondly, The Body ought to be hea∣vy enough to sink in all Liquors but Quick-silver, (for in That, none but Gold is ponderous enough to sink.) But if your Tryals are to be made Page  69 upon Liquors that belong to the Ve∣getable, or Animal, Kingdom, the Body you imploy need not be near so ponderous; tho' it ought to be more so than Water, because (as I found by Tryals purposely made) some Liquors, that are very Spiri∣tous and Volatile, are yet much hea∣vier in Specie, than Water. 'Tis not very easie to pitch upon such a single Solid, as may have all the Qualities in reference to our Purpo∣ses, that may be desired in it, if it be to be made use of for a long time. For Thirdly, Besides that, it ought not to lose of its Weight, (and conse∣quently to change it,) by the insen∣sible Avolation of Effluvia, and that it must be, as was freshly noted, of a considerable specifick Gravity. Fourthly, It ought not to be too big, or too intensely heavy, lest it be too heavy for a tender Ballance, or re∣quire too much Liquor to inviron it. Fifthly, It ought to be of such a Tex∣ture as not to be dissolved, or corroded by any of the several Liquors, some Page  70 of which may be sharp and pierc∣ing Menstruums, that 'tis to be weigh'd in; and those too of differing Natures. Sixthly, It should also be of such a Make, as is not easily lyable to be broken, or otherwise spoil'd, that it may last, till all the design'd Expe∣riments, tho' many, be made with it. Seventhly, and lastly, 'tis desira∣ble, that it should be of a natural and uniform, as to Sense, and pro∣curable Substance; that the Experi∣ments, made with it, may be easily enough communicated to Others, and, if they think fit, tryed over again by them; and that, if any be judged worthy, they may be transmitted to Posterity.
Several Bodies there are, that I looked upon as more fit than most Others to be imploy'd about the Tryals, we are treating of. The chie• of these were Brimstone, Hard Wax Ivory, and White Marble. But tho each of these, especially if fitly shaped, may be of use on some parti∣cular occasions; yet every one wan¦ted Page  71 some of the desirable Qualifi∣cations lately mentioned. And there∣fore, I made much more use of Three other Bodies, not because they were such as I could Wish; but because they were the least remote from be∣ing such, among those I could Pro∣cure. The first of these was a piece of Amber between Three and Four Drams in Weight, of an high Yellow Colour, but very Transparent, and of an uniform Texture and conve∣nient Shape. This was judged fit to be imployed, when we were to exa∣mine the lighter sorts of Liquors, such as common Water, Rain-water, &c. Wine, Brandy, rectified Spirit of Wine-Vinegar, and the Liquors drawn from it, Cydar, Beer, Ale, Urine, many Waters and Spirits destilled from Bodies belonging to the Vege∣table, and to the Animal, Kingdoms. But 'tis not proper for the more pon∣derous kind of Liquors; since 'twill not sink to the Bottom, but float at the Top, not only of some Liquors of the Mineral Kingdom, (as will Page  72 ere long appear;) but in several Liquors afforded us by the Saline parts of Bodies belonging to the Vegetable Kingdom; as you will find within a few Pages.
The Second Body, I imployed, was a Globular Glass, which I caused to be blown at a Lamp, and to be Her∣metically sealed at the Neck, which was purposely made very short, af∣ter there had been Lodged in it as much Quick-silver, and no more, as we guessed would serve to sink it in any Liquor, except Quick-silver; This, by reason of its great Bulk, in reference to its Weight, was fit to discover Differences in Weight, mi∣nute enough between the Liquors 'twas weighed in; and 'twas out of Danger of being corroded, even by sharp Menstruums; and therefore, on divers occasions, I preferred this In∣strument to any of the other Two; but 'tis disadvantag'd by these In∣conveniencies, that 'tis difficult to be made, or procured, that 'tis hard to be preserved, being very easie to Page  73 be broken, and that partly on this Account, and partly on Others, it can scarce be a fit Standard in refe∣rence to such Observations, as are to be communicated to Others, and transmitted to Posterity.
Wherefore for Experiments that are to be imparted & recorded, I made use of a Solid, which tho' heavier in Spe∣cie than was necessary to inable one to compare together the lighter sorts of Liquors, and to discover their minu∣ter Disparities in point of Weight, is yet a natural Standard not subject to be broken without gross Negli∣gence, nor to be dissolved, or cor∣roded by the Liquors, 'twas to be immerst in, however of various Kinds, and very sharp, and ponde∣rous enough to sink in all of them, except Quick-silver, and yet not near so ponderous, as the lightest Metals, or many Metalline Bodies; this Solid I speak of is Rock Chrystal, which I formerly represented, as for its Purity, Homogeneity, &c. fit to afford a Measure, to which other Page  74 Bodies may be compar'd in Weight, and by that means among them∣selves. And of this pure Concrete, we imployed an almost compleat Globe, (weighing in the Air ℥ij ʒss Grains 3,) save that it had in one part of it two small Holes near one another, and easily stopt up with hard Wax, after there had been put through them an Horse-hair, by whose means the Ball was easily fastened to the Scale from whence 'twas to hang in the Water. The bigness of this Glo∣bular Body made it the more fit to dis∣cover the lesser Differences between Liquors in point of intensive Gravity. But because we may have oftentimes occasion to know the Weight of Li∣quors, of which, by reason of their Preciousness, or Rarity, we can com∣mand but small Quantities, as it frequently happens, if we be to try the Weight of Chymical Oyls, Tin∣ctures, Essences, &c. We thought fit, for such Liquors, to provide a piece of Chrystal, such as Nature had framed it, viz. an Hexagonal Page  75 Prisme, with a kind of Pyramide at the end, which is opposite to the extream, at which 'twas broken off from the Body, it grew on. For this clear and finely shaped Chrystal, (or, what is very near of kin to it, white Amethyst) by reason of its ob∣long Figure, might be commodiously weigh'd in so slender a Cylindrical Glass, as required but a small Quan∣tity of Liquor to cover and surround a conveniently shap'd Body, that weighed, in the Air, but half an Ounce and sixteen Grains. And to ren∣der the Observations, made with these two Bodies of Medicinal and other Li∣quors, (for there are several of these Tryals, that belong not to this Tract) the more useful to Experimenters, I shall here desire you to take notice once for all, that the Ball of Chry∣stal was to Water of the same Bulk, as 2 57/100 to 1 or thereabouts; and the Prismatical Oblong piece of Chry∣stal was to a Quantity of the same Liquor, equal to it in Magnitude, as 2 66/100 to 1.
Page  76I have the more particularly deli∣vered the Way of exploring the Gravity of several Liquors with one Solid, because there may be made of it a couple of Applications, that may, on several occasions, be of use, not only to Chymists, Physicians and Apothecaries, but to divers other Experimenters, that are not of either of their Professions.
These Applications do, I confess, belong to another Paper, (viz. an Essay about some Uses of Chymistry improved) that was written divers years ago. But since, by reason of the loss of divers Leaves of it, I know not whether, much less when, 'twill come abroad, I shall at present borrow some few things of it to ac∣commodate my present Design.
First then, the piece of clear Am∣ber formerly mentioned, or some such convenient Body, that is not too little, nor in Specie, too heavy, may serve the Chymist, Apothecary, and others, to make probable Guesses of the Degree of Spirituosity, or of Thin∣ness, Page  77 that is to be found in many Liquors belonging to the Vegetable, or the Animal, Kingdom; which may be done with far less Error by this Way, than by those uncertain Signs, on which the common Ways of guessing are wont to be grounded. For having once provided a Liquor, by Comparison whereto One may safely make Estimates of Others of the same Kind, or Denomination, 'twill be easie, by observing the differing Weights of the Amber in several Liquors to judge of the Fine∣ness of any of them in its Kind; for, Caeteris paribus, That is the thinnest, or abounds most in Spirituous parts, where the Solid weighs more than in the Other, as for instance, The Amber we imployed, that in Water weighed 6 ¾ Grains, in common Red French Wine weighed 8 ½ Grains, in common Brandy of a pretty good sort, such as that of Nantz 1• 1/• Grains, and in vinous Spirits highly rectified 34 1/• Grains. The same Way one may imploy, to judge of Page  78 the Strength of Spirits of Vinegar, Acetum Radicatum, &c. but with a great difference in the Application. For it may pass for a general Rule, That, 'tis probable, that, of Liquors destilled from Wine, Cydar, Ale, and other fermented Liquors, the Hydro∣statical Body (if I may so call it) weighs more or less, according as the Liquor 'tis weighed in, is more or less Spirituous; but, on the con∣trary, in Acid Spirits and Liquors, the less the Solid weighs, the stron∣ger One may repute that Liquor to be: That greater Decrement of Weight proceeding usually from the greater Proportion, it contains, of Salts that are not Volatile.
I must not here pretermit one Conve∣nience of the Way newly proposed, that may, in tract of time, save you some Money, and, at least, will ena∣ble you to Husband better, than in the vulgar Method you can, Li∣quors that you may have but small Quantities of, or that are worthy to be preserved. For, you know, 'tis Page  79 usual with many Chymists, and espe∣cially those that are more circum∣spect than others, to try the Good∣ness of their Spirit of Wine, or Bran∣dy, or other Spirits drawn from fer∣mented Liquors, by setting Fire to a spoonful of the Spirit to be examin'd, in order to see, how much of it is totally inflammable, and how great, or little, a Portion of Phlegm will be left behind. But, not here to mention the Scruples I propose in another Paper, about this Way of trying Ardent Spirits, I shall now only take notice, that, by the new∣ly recited Way, you lose or spoil all that you try, and the better the Spirit is, the greater is your Loss, whereas by the Hydrostatical Way, the Liquor is examined without be∣ing destroyed.
'Tis now fit to add, that, by the help of the foregoing Observations, One may also make Estimates of Li∣quors of the same kind not destilled, whether fermented or not fermented; as several Sorts of Beer, or of Ale, or of Page  80 Cydar, or of Juices of Apples, or of Pears, newly prest out. And the same Hydrostatical Solid may be imployed, to compare with one another, in point of intensive Weight, Liquors of differing kinds, as Wine, Beer, Ale, Meads, Cydar, Perry, Verjuice, exprest Oyls, Essential Oyls of diffe∣ring Bodies, &c.
But, in case the Liquors to be im∣ployed be very ponderous, Amber will not be a fit Solid to be examined about them; for I have found by Tryal, (what one would scarce sus∣pect) not only that it would swim or float, in divers Liquors made by Solution of Salts, whether in the moist Air, or even in Water, such as Oil of Tartar per Deliquium, Soluti∣on of Salt of Tartar in as little Wa∣ter as may be, and Solution of the Salt of Pot-ashes, &c. But some destilled Liquors would not suffer my pellucid Amber to sink to the Bot∣tom, as I found by Tryal made with Oil of Vitriol, with Spirit of Nitre, and even with good Spirit of Salt.
Page  81Besides, there may be another Use made of our Hydrostatical Solid, which may, on divers occasions, be as Ser∣viceable to Experimenters in gene∣ral, by assisting them to proportion, to their purposes, the Strength of the Menstruums, and other Liquors, they are to imploy; as the former use is to Destillers and Apothecaries, for discovering the Strength of the already prepared Liquors, that they would examine. For there are di∣vers Experiments, that either do not succeed, or, at least, do not suc∣ceed so well, unless the Menstruums, or other Liquors, imployed in ma∣king them, be of a determinate De∣gree of Strength, (which is usually knowable by a certain Degree of intensive Weight.) This will be the more easily granted, if (as I have elsewhere shewn) the Strength and Spirituosity even of some Li∣quors, whose chief Virtue and Use is to be good Solvents, may yet be unfit to dissolve, as well because their Strength exceeds a certain Mea∣sure, Page  82 as because, by their Weakness, they fall short of it; Of this, I re∣member, I gave an Instance in Aqua Fortis, whose strength, as it's Name intimates, is reckon'd the best Qua∣lity it can have; for I found, that if it were rectified so much as to make it as strong, as we could, or but somewhat less strong than that, it would not dissolve Silver, but re∣quired to be weakened by an Addi∣tion of Water; and I found, that the Menstruum, tho' it were not much rectified, would not near so well dissolve the Filings or Raspings of crude Lead, when 'twas moderately strong and fit to dissolve Silver, as when 'twas allayed with a considera∣ble Quantity of Water, especially if afforded by Rain, or by Destillation. I shall add, that, in making Extra∣ctions from many vegetable Substan∣ces, for Medicinal Uses, Chymists themselves may fall into a Mistake, when they affect to employ their most rectified Spirit of Wine, as the best Menstruum for their purpose: Page  83 For the Medicinal Virtue of not a few such Bodies does not reside only in what Chymists call their Sulphur, and might perhaps more properly be called the Resinous Part, which indeed is best dissolved by such Spirit of Wine, as is carefully de∣phlegm'd; but also in a more Gum∣mous, and, partly perhaps, almost Mucilaginous Substance, for whose Extraction a moderately Phlegma∣tick Spirit is more proper; be∣cause of the Aqueous Portion, that is mingled with the inflammable One; since we see, that some Gum∣mous Bodies, as Gum Arabick, Gum Tragacanth, &c. are not disposed to be dissolved by the best rectified Spirit of Wine, as they are by A∣queous Liquors, as Water, weak Spirit of Wine, &c. and some, tho' dissoluble in both kinds of Menstru∣ums, are yet less easily so in strong Spirit of Wine, than in waterish Menstruums; as may be observed particularly in Myrrh; for other In∣stances applicable to these Adver∣tisements Page  84 belong to another Paper.
And what has been now said, may serve to persuade you, that it may be of good use, on divers Occasi∣ons, to take Notice of the Degree of Strength of the Menstruum, or other Liquor, we employ about this or that nice Experiment; that when we have occasion to reiterate it to the same Purpose only, we may be able to bring the Liquor we make use of to the same Degree of Strength with That, which we for∣merly emyloyed, and by which the design'd Effect was produced. But, in Experiments that should be very Critically made, 'twill not be amiss to bear in mind this Caution, that if the Liquor be very ponderous in Spe∣cie, as Oil of Vitriol, or Oil of Tar∣tar per del quium, 'twill be fit to put something into the Scale, from which the Solid hangs, to make Compen∣sation for that part of the Hair that is immersed, since Horse-hair not being of the same Specifick Gravity with this Liquor, (tho' it be pre∣sumed Page  85 to be so with common Wa∣ter) is to be considered, as a some∣what lighter Body, capable of buoy∣ing up the Solid a little; and therefore its Comparative Levity should be compensated.
CHAP. XII.
BEsides the Way, we come from discoursing of, there is indeed another Way, which we have, on divers Occasions, found useful, to compare different Liquors, that are of the same Magnitude, in point of Weight. This is done by successive∣ly filling a Vial greater, or smaller, furnished with a pretty long and slender Cylindrical Stem, to a cer∣tain stable Mark made near the Top, with the several Liquors to be com∣pared together in point of Gravity.
But this Way I must here do no more than name, not so much be∣cause I speak of it in a convenient Page  86 place of another Paper, as because 'tis not Hydrostatical. But there is also another Way to discover, Whe∣ther or no, Two, or more, Liquors proposed differ in Specifick Weight, and to make some, not groundless, Estimate of their Differences. This is done by a hollow Cylinder of Brass, or other Metal, made somewhat hea∣vy at the bottom to make it swim upright, that sinks more, or less in several Liquors, as they are lighter, or heavier, one than another. But the diligent Mersennus himself, who proposes this Way, confesses it to be very difficult to make sure Obser∣vations by it. To which, I shall therefore add but this, that, being a Metal, it may be corroded by Acid Menstruums, and if it be of Brass, or Copper, it may be wrought upon or injur'd by Urinous Men∣struums, too.
What Mersennus said of this In∣strument, may be applied to ano∣ther, tho' differing from it, both in Shape and Matter. For 'tis made of Page  87 two Glass Bubbles, and a very slen∣der Stem, which is Hermetically Sealed with a Ballast in the lower∣most of Quick-silver, to keep it stea∣dy, when partly immerst in Liquors, in which this Instrument, like the Metalline Cylinder, sinks deeper in lighter Liquors, than in heavier, in a measure somewhat answerable to their Differences in Gravity. But, tho' I have, on several occasions, em∣ployed these Instruments, and found them not unuseful, when I did not confine my self to One, or Two, but made use of several of different Sizes, according to the various Liquors, I was to examine; yet what you may elsewhere find about this In∣strument, dispenses me from say∣ing any more of it in this place, than that, for some of the ends aimed at in this Chapter, it is inferior to the Way of examining Liquors by the help of the Ballance.
There is also another Way, that is Hydrostatical, proposed by Mer∣sennus, of weighing of Liquors in Page  88 Water, and it is This; He bids you take a Glass Vial, to which, being first weighed in Air, and then in Water, you are to adjust a Stopple of Wax, or Cork, that will fit it exactly. This done, you are to fill the Vial with the Liquor you would exa∣mine, so that no Air be left be∣tween it, and the Stopple. The Vessel thus filled, you are to weigh in Water, and substract from its Weight there, the formerly noted Weight of the Glass it self in Wa∣ter, and also That of the Stopple; which done, the remains will give the Weight of the Liquor proposed in Water. This Method I lately chanced to find propounded by (the Writer newly nam'd) the industri∣ous Mersennus in his Hydraulicks; but, I remember not, that he affirms himself to have made use of it; And tho' it may be serviceable on some occasions, yet, I fear, it will be troublesome in Practice. For, (to omit some inconvenient Circum∣stances) ordinary Vials, capable of Page  89 containing a competent Quantity of Liquor, are, usually, too heavy to be imployed with tender Ballances; and common Stopples (such as Mer∣sennus may be well supposed to have imployed) will be subject to divers inconveniencies; as, that they may be penetrated by some Liquors, and corroded by others, and if they be made of Cork, or of common Wax, or any other Substance lighter, in Specie, than Water, 'twill not be easie to find its specifick Gravity; espe∣cially since Evaporation, and other Accidents make this it self vary; and whatever Matter, Vegetable or Ani∣mal, it be made of, the Vessel will cost you two Operations, One to dis∣cover the Weight of the Vessel in Wa∣ter, and the Other that of the Stopple,(at that time) which is troublesome. Wherefore, when I met with this Way in the ingenious Mersennus, it seemed to me more inconvenient, than One, that, I remember, I had formerly thought of, and which I have sometimes put in Practice, by Page  90 chusing a Vial not too large, and of a round Figure, that being the most capacious under such a Superficies, and, instead of other Stopples, fit∣ting it with one of (the like) Glass, carefully ground to the Neck of it. For, by this means, the inconvenien∣cies of a Stopple lighter than Water were avoided, nor would the Stop∣ple alter its specifick Gravity, either by Imbibition, or Evaporation, nor would it be penetrated by the most subtil Spirits, nor corroded by the most fretting Ones. To which may be added, because, in some Cases, it may be considerable, that a Glass∣stopple, as it will not be wrought on by the Liquor contained in the Vial, so it will not communicate any Tincture, or extraneous Quality, to the Liquor, which cannot be affirm∣ed of a Stopple of Cork or Wax, in reference to some Subtil and very Corrosive, or otherwise very penetra∣ting Liquors, this Hydrostatical Bot∣tel (as for distinction sake I call it) being together with its Stopple care∣fully Page  91 weighed, First in Air, and then in Water, (that the Gravity of the whole Instrument in that Liquor may be setled once for all) we fill'd it exactly with the Liquor to be exa∣mined, and so proceeded, as we if were to weigh Quck-silver according to the Manner formerly declared in the Eigth Chapter. The Weight of the given Liquor in Water being thus obtai∣ned, its Proportion in Weight to Water of the same Bulk may be easily discovered by the Way for∣merly delivered in the Second Chap∣ter (or the Tenth Chapter.) This way of examining Liquors may, on some occasions, do good Service, and I did the rather, now and then, make use of it, because 'tis applicable to all kind of Liquors, whether heavier in Specie than Water, or lighter.
If you lay aside the Stopple, the round Ball it self may be made use of, on several Occasions, instead of that Hydrostatical Bucket, for∣merly mentioned; for the weighing Page  92 of Quck-silver, and divers heavy Powders; especially if they be Course Ones. But if the Instrument be fit∣ly shaped, and not too heavy, there may belong to it a greater Conve∣niency than. This. For when you have, and are willing to spare, Li∣quor enough to inviron the little Bottle, it may be usefully substitu∣ted to the Hydrostatical Bubble, with Quick-silver inclosed, that I former∣ly recommended. For, by reason of its exact Stopple, it has no need of an Hermetick Seal, (which is not easie to be be made or procured▪) and 'tis far less Subject to be broken, than a Bubble. And yet that which I most made use of, (and which weighed a∣bout ℥i ʒii•ss. Grains xix, or 709 Grains) being well stopt with only Air in it, would link by its own Weight in Water, and in Liquors lighter than This, as Wine, Brandy, &c. And if it were to be imployed in Liquors much more Ponderous than Water, as Aqua Fortis, Oil of Tartar perdeliquium, &c. 'twas easie Page  93 to make it fit to be weighed in them also; by putting into it a Quantity of Quick-silver (or some other fit Body) of a determinate Weight, as two, three or four Drams, before we stopped it: Which Ba∣last, when the Operation is over, may, if it be Quick-silver, be easily taken totally out, and kept apart for the like Uses: and the empty Bottle, and Stopple, may thereby become fit again, to be weighed in Water and lighter Liquors.
But notwithstanding all this, be∣cause Glasses, for size, shape, and weight, fit for Ballances, tender enough, and furnisht with Glass Stopples exactly fitted to them, are very difficult to procure; and the Way it self is subject to some of the Inconveniencies, that we imputed to other Ways not long since mentioned: it seems, that, generally speaking,* this Way of finding the Weight of Liquors in Water, is Inferiour for common use, to those more simple Ones, that we formerly recommend∣ed.
Page  94
CHAP. XIII.
*HAving now laid down the Me∣thod of weighing one Liquor in another, 'tis allowable, and may be fit, that we subjoyn some Appli∣cation of it: Especially, because it will become me to make good, in some measure, what, I remember, I formerly hinted to you, viz. that, in the subsequent part of this Paper, there would be delivered a further Use, which may be counted the VIth. of the Hydrostaticks in exa∣mining Medicinal Bodies. And tho' by the Instances we lately had oc∣casion to propose in some of the Chapters preceding This, divers things referable to this Use, are set down already; Yet I should not content my Self, (as I now must do) to point at the chief Heads or Kinds of things referable to it; if, on a Sub∣ject that is more fertile, than it seems, Page  95 want of leisure did not restrain me from descending to treat of the par∣ticular Instances, that belong to them.
Among the Services then, that the Hydrostaticks may do a sagacious Physician, I must not omit One, tho' it has not hitherto, that I know of, been propounded by any Author. And, I hope, you will not think it improper to be taken notice of here, tho' it do not regard only the Mate∣ria Medica, but is applicable (as I may elsewhere relate that I made it) to divers Subjects, that are refera∣ble to other Parts of Physiology: Since divers Bodies, that seem not so directly to regard the Materia Medica, as 'tis usually reposited in the Shops of Drugsters, have been, in some times and places, and may deservedly be now made to afford Matter for Remedies, to a free and ingenious Physician.
I consider then, that there are ma∣ny Liquors, whose specifick Gravity it may be useful to know, not only, as Page  96 it may help to distinguish Genuine, or well conditioned Ones, from Them that are not so, but for other good Purposes too.
Instances of this kind may be afforded by the Juices of Herbs and Fruits; where (according to the Di∣rection given in the last Chapter) we first weigh a determinate Quantity, as an Ounce, or so many Drams, in our Hydrostatical Jar, or Bucket; and putting some Oil of Turpentine on it, we sink it warily into that Liquor; whose specifick Gravity in reference to refined Silver, clear Rock Chrystal, (or some other Body, if we know it to be as pure) has been carefully found out and registred: For, by this means, (as we have lately manifested) substituting this Oil for common Water, we may discover the specifick Gravity of Liquors, not to be weighed in Water, because they mingle with it. And thus we may find, not only the difference in Ponderosity between the Juices of Page  97 Plants of differing kinds, as of Wormwood and Roses, and some∣times of the subordinate Species of the same Genus, as of Absynthium Vulgare, Ponticum, Romanum, &c. and Roses White, Red, Damask, Yel∣low, &c. but we may on some oc∣casions observe, whether, and, if at all, how far, the keeping of a Juice for some time, more or less, or the Fermentation of it, or the Putrefa∣ction, will alter its specifick Gravity. There are also other Liquids us'd by Physicians, and not ponderable in Water, that may be by this Way examin'd, as Honey, Vinegar, Ver∣juice, &c. And by the same Way may be also discovered and compa∣red, the specifick Weight of the Juices of Fruits of different kinds, as of Grapes, Apples, Pears, Quin∣ces, &c. and of subordinate Species belonging to the same Genus, as the newly expressed Juices, that make Sacks, French-wines, Rhenish-wines, &c. and those Liquors, that are pressed out of several sorts of Page  98 Apples, as Pippins, Pear-mains, John-Apples, Queen-Apples, &c. And in divers of these, a Person that is curious enough, may probably, by the Method we have been proposing, be enabled to take Notice of the Dif∣ferences produced in the specifick Gravity (whose Changes are usu∣ally accompanied with those of Con∣sistence, &c.) in the several succes∣sive States, wherein the Liquors may be found at different times; as (not to mention the Juice of unripe Grapes, viz. Verjuice) the Juice of ripe Grapes is in very differing States, when 'tis newly pressed out; when it begins to ferment; when 'tis yet but New Wine; when it has attain'd its full Maturity and Perfection; when it begins to degenerate into Ropy, prick'd Wine, &c. and when 'tis ab∣solutely changed into Vinegar, or else into Vappa.
But here it ought not to be con∣cealed from you, That in this kind of Experiments, to make use suc∣cessfully of the Hydrostatical Bucket Page  99 is a Task difficult enough, for Rea∣sons that a few Tryals will easily dis∣cover. And therefore, tho' I would not discourage the Skilful, yet for those that do not find themselves dextrous at making Experiments, I think it adviseable to imploy, in∣stead of the Bucket, Amber, or some other convenient Hydrostatical So∣lid, or rather (which is better) a Glass-bottle and Stopple, such as We formerly described; but as large, as may well be imploy'd without over-loading, or injuring, the Bal∣lance.
CHAP XIV.
AS I thought 'twas fit to give the foregoing Advertisement, by way of Caution, in the Cases that oc∣casioned it; so having considered the Nature and Scope of the Hydro∣statical Experiments in General, that belong to this Essay; I shall venture Page  100 to add for the Encouragement of those, that are better furnished with inquisitive Minds, than with nice Bal∣lances; that tho' in divers Tryals, especially Those that are made about precious things, as Gold, Pearls, Diamonds and other Gems; there is no relying upon any, but very Good and tender Ballances; Yet, on many other occasions, 'tis not necessary, tho' it be desirable, that the Scales, we employ, should be extraordinary Good. And this for two Reasons: First, because many Hydrostatical Experiments are such, that a little Variation from the exact Proportion of the Solid to the Liquor, or be∣tween Bodies of the same Denomi∣nation, can lead us into no conside∣rable Error; or, at least, not defeat the Experimenters main Design; as, with a Ballance that is not nice, One may sufficiently distinguish be∣tween an human Calculus, and a Peb∣ble, or other ordinary Stone; and be∣tween Course and Fine, native Cin∣nabar: And between a true Guinea, Page  101 or other piece of coyned Gold, that is not very small, and a counter∣feit One, of Brass, or any such mix∣ture, tho' never so finely guilt.
And Secondly, Because, as there are few Physical Experiments, where∣in Mathematical Preciseness is ne∣cessary, and fewer wherein 'tis to be expected; So in many Hydrostati∣cal Tryals, 'tis very probable, that the difference of Bodies of the same kind, or Denomination, flowing from their Compositions, and inter∣nal Textures, will make a discer∣nable, tho' but small, difference in their specifick Gravity: As, in Rock-Chrystal it self, we have found some pieces to be to Water, as 2 1/10, or a little more, to One; and others, to be to the same Liquor, as Two and Six, or between Six and Seven Tenths to One. And therefore, how exact soever the Ballance be, there must be some Allowance made for the diversity, that may be found in the Bodies themselves, that are exami∣ned, which diversity may perhaps Page  102 produce, at least, as great a Diffe∣rence in the Proportions we seek for, as needs to be expected from a small Difference of tenderness, in the Ballances we imploy. And indeed, neither One of those Differences, nor the Other, (nor perhaps Both toge∣ther,) is wont to be so considerable, as to challenge much regard in Phy∣sical Experiments; or at least, as to hinder it to be true, that, on most occa∣sions, the Hydrostatical Way of exa∣mining the specifick Weight of Bo∣dies, is preferable by far to any o∣ther Way of doing it, that has been Practised.
Before I proceed to the remaining part of this Essay, it will be worth while to obviate an Objection, that I foresee may be made by Critical Naturalists, against the Method hi∣therto deliver'd, of finding the Pro∣portion in Weight, betwixt a sink∣ing Body, and Water of the same Bulk. For it speciously may, and probably will, be objected, that, by this Method, we cannot discover Page  103 the Proportion between a Solid Bo∣dy, and Water in General; but only betwixt the proposed Body, and the particular Water 'tis weighed in; because there may be a great Dispa∣rity between Liquors that are cal∣led, and that deservedly, common Water. And some Travellers tell us from the Press, that the Water of an Eastern River, which, if I mi∣stake not, is Ganges, is by a Fifth part lighter than our Water.
But to this plausible Objection, I have Two things to Answer.
And First, having had, upon seve∣ral occasions, the Opportunity, as well as Curiosity, to examine the Weight of divers Waters, some of them taken up in Places very distant from one another; I found the diffe∣rence between their specifick Gra∣vities far less, than almost any Body would expect. And if I be not much deceived by my Memory, (which I must have recourse to, because I have not by me the Notes I took of those Tryals) the difference between Page  104 VVaters, where One would expect a notable Disparity, was but about the Thousandth part (and some∣times perchance very far less) of the VVeight of either. Nor did I find any Difference considerable, in refe∣rence to our Question, between the VVeight of divers VVaters of diffe∣ring kinds, as Spring-water, River-water, Rain-water, and Snow-water, tho' this last were somewhat lighter, than any of the rest. And having had the Curiosity to procure some VVater brought into England, if I much mis-remember not, from the River Ganges it self; I found it very little, if at all lighter, than some of our common VVaters.
And now I shall represent in the Second place, that I do not pretend, (and indeed 'tis not necessary) that the Proportion, obtainable by our Method, should have a Mathema∣cal Preciseness. For in Experiments where we are to deal with gross Matter, and to imploy about it ma∣terial Instruments; 'tis sufficient to Page  105 have a Physical, and almost impos∣sible to obtain (unless sometimes by Accident) a Mathematical Exact∣ness; as they will scarce deny, that have, as I have done, considered, and made Tryal of the Difficulties, that oppose the Attainment of such a Preciseness.

CHAP. XV. Hydrostatical Stereometry, Applyed to the MATERIA MEDICA.
SECT. I.
THere is an Use of Hydrosta∣ticks, which tho' it do not di∣rectly tend to the Examen of Drugs, or Simples received into the Materia Medica, yet may be Serviceable both to the Physician and the Naturalists, in delivering their Descriptions; and so it may indirectly conduce to the knowledge of them; and help, on some occasions, to distinguish be∣tween Genuine Simples (especially Fruits) and those that are not so; Page  107 'Tis known, that the Writers of the Materia Medica are wont to set down the Bigness of the Bodies they describe, by very uncertain Guesses; and those that, to be more accurate, assign them determinate Measures, are wont to do it, by saying, that such a Fruit, or other Body, is, for Example, an Inch, or two Inches, or half a Foot long; and half an Inch, or a whole Inch, or two Inches and an half, in breadth. But 'tis obvi∣ous to those that are not great Stran∣gers to the Mathematicks, that, ac∣cording to this Way of describing Bodies, there may be, by reason of the great Variety of Figures, espe∣cially irregular Ones, they are capa∣ble of, a very great Disparity of Magnitude, or Bulk, in Bodies, to each of which, the same Length and Breadth may belong or be ap∣plyed.
I should here be able to present you an Hydrostatical Way of deter∣mining the Bulk of Bodies, both much nearer the Truth, than that Page  108 newly recited, and grounded as well on Experiments as Mathematicks; if among other Papers, I had not un∣fortunately lost One, that I wrote many years ago, about the measur∣ing of Solids, by the help of Liquors. But tho' I cannot, out of my Memory, recover the Theoretical part of that Writing, (whose Loss I regret, be∣cause it had been examined by One of the exactest, as well as famousest, Mathematicians of our Age, whom I invited to be present at the chief Experiments) yet, I think, I can call to mind as much of the PracticalApplications of it, as may suffice for my present purpose.
The ground of the Way, I am about to propose to you, will be easily understood by the following, tho' but short, Account. I caused to be carefully made by skilful Artifi∣cers several Cubes, both of different Sizes and different Materials, as Mar∣ble and Metal; whose sides were each of them, as near as the Artist could make them, either an exact Inch, or precisely more Inches than Page  109 One, according to our English mea∣sure; which is said to differ very little from the correspondent One of the old Romans. These Cubes were carefully weighed in trusty Ballan∣ces: First, in the Air, and then in common Water. And tho' I found some little (and but little) difference, between the Products of the Tryals; yet that Difference being no more than might reasonably be expected from the scarce avoidable Imper∣fection, even of good Artists and their Tools; We concluded, that One might, without any considera∣ble Error, take a Medium (as they speak,) between these Products, and allow even to this Medium, a Lati∣tude of some Grains; since that La∣titude will not amount to the Sixtieth part of the Weight of a Cubical Inch of Water. Since therefore some of our Tryals inclin'd us to judge, that about Two hundred and sixty; and some others to think, that about Two hundred fifty two; and o∣thers again, that about Two hun∣dred Page  110 fifty six, came nearest to the true Weight of a Cubical Inch of Water; we thought our selves at liberty to make use of that Num∣ber, that should appear most com∣modious for Practice, by reason of its Divisions and Subdivisions into A∣liquote Parts; Especially if the Bo∣dy to be examined were not great; since, in that Case, Two or three Grains more or less would not be considerable, especially in a Physi∣cal Experiment, where Geometrical exactness is not to be expected, nor indeed required; and a far less ac∣curate Estimate will be less unac∣curate, than can with any certainty be made by the formerly mentioned Way of judging, by the Length, Breadth, and Depth (or Thickness) of the Body proposed.
I made the less Scruple to pitch upon the last of the Three foremen∣tioned Numbers of Grains, not only, because it affords many Aliquote parts for a Number that is no greater, since barely by a successive Biparti∣tion, Page  111 it affords Seven such Parts, viz. 128.64.32.16.8.4. and 2; But, because I was incouraged by an Experiment differing from those already mentioned. For, having cau∣sed to be purposely made by a good Artist, an hollow Cube of Brass, whose Cavity was fitted to contain a just Cubical Inch of Matter; (either Solid or Liquid,) we put it into one Scale of a tender Ballance, with a just Counterpoize in the other, and pla∣ced it there, as Horizontally as we could. Then we warily put into it, little by little, as much common Wa∣ter, as it would contain, without ei∣ther overflowing, or having its Sur∣face, manifestly turgid; putting also from time to time in the opposite Scale, small Weights to keep it from swerving too much at once from an Aequilibrium. And tho' it is ex∣tremely difficult in Practice, to dis∣cern with certainty, when the Vessel is so exactly filled, that a Drop, or even Two, or Three drops, more or less, cannot be added, or taken a∣way, Page  112 without being observable by the Eye; Yet, for this very Reason, we thought our Experiment agreea∣ble enough to our Supposition, when we found, that by so light an Alte∣ration, the Weight of the Water, when the Scales were heedfully Counterpoized, amounted to near about Two hundred fifty six Grains, which Number we shall therefore hereafter imploy, as expres∣sing the Weight of a Cubical Inch of Water.
And now to apply the past Dis∣course to our present Purpose.
Suppose, for Example, that a Solid, heavier in Specie than Water, ha∣ving been weighed first in the Air, be found to lose of its Weight in the Water ℥ss Sixteen Grains, that is, Two hundred fifty six Grains, I say, that the Dimensions of this Solid, if it were of a Cubical shape, would make it equal to a Cubical Inch: So that, (to express the thing yet more clearly,) if the given Body be supposed to be an easily fusible Page  113 Metal, as Tin, or Lead; and be∣ing melted to be warily poured in∣to the hollow Cube formerly men∣tioned, and suffered to cool, it would just fill it and no more; and consequently be a Cube of Metal; whose Length, Breadth and Depth are equal to one another, and each of them to an Inch. For, as 'tis a Fun∣damental Theorem in Hydrostaticks; demonstrated Mathematically by Ar∣chimedes, and else where Physically by me; that a sinking Solid weighs lesse in Water than in Air, by the Weight of as much Water as is equal to the Solid in Bulk; and since we have lately shewn by Experi∣ments, that a Cubical Inch of Wa∣ter weighs ℥ss. 16.) Grains, that is, 256 Grains; it will follow, that when the Decrement of a Bodies weight in Water is found to be 256 Grains, the Solid content of that Body is a Cubical Inch: Since an Aqueous Body weighing 256 Grains is equal in Magnitude, as well to Page  114 the Solid propounded, as to a Cu∣bick Inch of Water. And here it may prevent a Scruple, to ob∣serve, that, to make Bodies equal in Magnitude, it is not at all necessa∣ry, that they should be of the same Weight, or of the same Matter; as is evident in Bullets of Copper, Tin and Gold, cast separately and dex∣trously in the same Mould. For tho' they be equal in Bulk; yet the Bullet of Copper will be much, heavier than that of Tin; and the Bullet of pure Gold will be more than twice as heavy, as that of Copper. When∣soever therefore you meet with a So∣lid, ponderous enough to sink in Water, that being weighed in that Liquor loses • Grains of the Weight it had in the All•• you may conclude, the Magnitude o• Bulk of that Body to be equal to a Cubical Inch; of whatever Matter it consists, not of what Shape soever, regular or irre∣gular, it be. And in case the Solid proposed do (as it will very often Page  115 happen) lose of its Weight in the Water less than 256 Grains; you may conclude its Bulk to be propor∣tionably less than a Cubical Inch. And such is the Conveniency of the Number we have pitch'd upon, which abounds in Aliquote parts; that eve∣ry 32 Grains, that the Solid loses of its Weight in the Water, answers to an Eighth (that is, half a Quar∣ter) of an Inch in the Bulk of the Body: as, if the Decrement be 128 Grains, the Solid will be half a Cu∣bick Inch; and if it be but 64 Grains, 'twill be but a quarter of a Cubick Inch; and so if it be 160 Grains, 'twill be •/•, that is, half and half a quarter of an Inch Cube: and on the other side, if the Decrement of the given Body exceed the Standard, viz. 256 Grains, twice, thrice, &c. then that Decrement being reduced to Grains, as suppose it weigh ℥i + Grains 32 (amounting to 512 Grains;) or ℥i ss + Grains 48 (amounting to 768 Grains) the Body will be equal Page  116 to two or three (single) Cubical Inches. And if, after the Division there remains a Fraction, 'twill not be difficult to estimate it, to him that considers what has been newly delivered.
SECT. II.
TO discover Hydrostatically the Solid Contents of a Body hea∣vier in Specie than Water; to him that knows how to make use of the Method newly delivered, 'twill not not be very difficult. But to mea∣sure, by the help of Water, the Soli∣dity of a Body lighter in Specie, than that Liquor; is a work not so easily performed. It may somewhat lessen the Difficulty, to premise, that there are two sorts of Bodies, that will naturally not sink in Water. For some are of a closer Texture, and Page  117 will not be easily invaded by that Liquor; at least, in so short a time, as they are of necessity to be kept in it: and others abound with Pores, that dispose them to imbibe the Water, they must be kept immersed in, till the Experiment be dispatched.
To begin with the First sort of Bodies: 'Tis known to Hydrostatici∣ans, that, according to a Theorem of Archimedes, the weight of a Body belonging to that kind, may be ga∣thered from the weight of the Water, that is equal, in Magnitude, to that part of the Body, that is immerst in that Liquor, when the Solid floats freely upon it; as, if a Paralelipipe∣don, or a Cylinder, of Wood, 12 In∣ches long, being placed upon Water, should rest there, when a 12th part of it lyes beneath the Surface of the Liquor; in this case, the Weight of the Water, equal in Bulk to that im∣merst 12th part, would be equal to the weight of the whole wooden Body. But because the Bodies, whose Bulk Physi∣•ians and Chymists may have occa∣sion Page  118 to Examine, will very seldom hap∣pen to have Shapes so near those of regular Ones; 'twill scarce be worth our while to inlarge upon this Way of Estimating light Bodies; which 'twill be so troublesome to make fit for most Mens Practice, that, unless it be desired, I shall not trouble you with it; but forthwith proceed to what will conduce far more to our present Design, which being, To measure the Solid Contents of Bodies, not so heavy (intensively) as Water, and for the most part irregularly shap'd; It will be necessary, that we imploy a Method differing from what we have hitherto made use of. In the First step of this, tho' not in the Second, we may be helped by the industrious Mersennus: Who proba∣bly borrowed his Way of Ghetal∣dus, from whose Promotus Archime∣des, he professedly borrows many things.
But because, that, on this occasion, Mersennus, affecting Brevity, hath made himself obscure; so that what Page  119 he writes can scarce be understood, but by Mathematical Perusers; I shall, for the sake of another sort of Readers, deliver the propounded Method, tho' not in so few words, yet more clearly, and orderly: First then, you shall weigh in the Air, the Body, (lighter than Water) to be examined: Secondly, you shall take a Place of Lead capable of making this Body sink with its self in Water, and of some Weight not incumbred with Fractions, as just a Dram, half an Ounce, an Ounce, &c. Thirdly, you must weigh this Plate in Water, and by substracting its Weight in this Liquor, from what it weigh'd in the Air, you must obtain a Dif∣ference, which will give the weight of as much Water, as is equal in Bulk to the immersed Lead. This, for distinctions sake, may be called, The specifick Weight of the Lead in Water. Fourthly, you must tye to∣gether (which you may best do by One or more Horse-hairs,) the Plate of Lead, and the lighter Body, and Page  120 note the Weight of the Aggregate; which, as you know, is nothing but the Sum of the respective Weights of the lighter, and of the heavier, Body. Fifthly, you must weigh this Aggregate in the Water, and sub∣stract its Weight in that Liquor, from the Weight that the same Ag∣gregate had in the Air; and the Difference will be the Specifick Weight of the said Aggregate in Water. Sixthly, From this Diffe∣rence, substract the formerly found Specifick Weight of the Plate alone in Water, and the Remains will give you the Weight of the lighter Body in the same Liquor.
Thus far our Author; without whose help, we may easily dispatch the rest of our Work, by the Me∣thod imployed already of measuring Solids heavier than Water. For the lately obtained Weight of the light Body in Water, being, (according to the Method formerly proposed,) divided by 256 Grains, will give you the Solid content of that natu∣rally floating Body.
Page  121But because a Method, that is dif∣ficult enough to be put in Practice by those that are not more than or∣dinarily well versed in Hydrosta∣ticks, requires to be illustrated by an Example; I shall subjoyn an Expe∣riment, that may serve, not only to clear up this Practice, but, in good mea∣sure, to confirm it too; We took then a piece of Oak conveniently shaped, and that weigh'd in Air, 193 ½ Grains. To this we tyed with an Horse-hair, a Plate of Lead weighing just half an Ounce, i. e. 240 Grains. But before we tyed them together, the Lead was weighed in Water, where it lost of its former Weight 20 Grains, which, being deducted out of the 240 Grains lately mentioned, left a Difference or residue of 20 Grains, for the Specifick Weight of this piece of Lead, (For I have sel∣dom found Lead quite so heavy) in the Water. Then the Aggregate of the Wood and Lead was weighed: First, in the Air, and found to be 433 Grains and an half, and Then in Page  122 Water, where it amounted but to 162 Grains; which being substra∣cted from the Aggregate of the same Bodies in the Air, the Residue, or Difference, was found to be 271 and ½ Grains: From which Difference, the other Difference of 20 Grains (which had been lately found) of the Leaden Plate alone in the Water, be∣ing deducted, there remained 251 Grains and ½ for the Weight of Water equal in Bulk to the given piece of Wood. If this number had amoun∣ted to 256 Grains, of which it fell short but 4 ½ Grains, we might have concluded the Solidity of it to be a Cubick Inch; since 256 Grains of Water, which we formerly found equal to a Bulk of Water of a Cu∣bick Inch, was also now found equal to the Bulk of the given piece of Wood. And indeed, intending (as I formerly intimated) to give an Ex∣ample, that should not only Illustrate, but Confirm, the proposed Practice; I caused the Wood I imployed to be formed into as exact a Cube of an Page  123 Inch every way, as I could procure from a Joyner, that bragged of the Pains he had taken about it: So that the Difference of its Weight in Wa∣ter from 256 Grains, the Weight of a full Cubick Inch of that Liquor, may probably be imputed to some little Imperfection in the Figure of the Wood, or some other light Cir∣cumstance, not considerable enough to be much regarded.
Of this Experiment one of my Notes gives the following Account.
I. The Oaken Cube in Air weighs (ʒiii Grains xiii ½.)
193 1/•.
II. The Weight of the Lead in Air, (ʒiv.)
240.
III. The Weight of the Lead in Water (ʒiiiss Grains x.) which, being substracted from its Weight in Air, leaves for its Specifick Weight in Water
220. 020.
IV. The Aggregate of the Two in Air is
433 1/•.
Page  124V. The weight of both together in Water, is — Which being substracted from its Weight in Air, gives the Difference of both the Ag∣gregates,
162. 271 ½.
VI. The Difference be∣tween the weight of Lead a∣lone in Air, and in Water, or which is all one, the Specifick weight of the Plate alone, viz. being substracted from the Dif∣ference of the weights of the Aggregates in Air, and in Wa∣ter, gives [for the weight of the Cube propos'd,]
020. 251 ½.
The Way of measuring Bodies, that has been hitherto delivered, is appropriated to such, as will not at all, or, at least, will not readily, be dissolved in Water. But because there are divers other Solids, as Lumps of Salt, Alume, Vitriol, Su∣gar, &c. whose Magnitudes it may be fit for inquisitive Men, of more Professions than One, to know, and to compare; I shall to what has been Page  125 already said, subjoyn this Adver∣tisement; That the same Way may be applyed to measure the Magni∣tudes of Solids dissoluble in Water, if, instead of this Liquor, we substi∣tute Oil of Turpentine; whose Pro∣portion, and Specifick Gravity to Water, we have found, or is other∣wise known to us. When I first made this Reflection, I had not such Conveniencies, as when I found the weight of a Cubick Inch of Water, to determine the weight of a Cubick Inch of Oil of Turpentine. But, having yet lying by me the hollow Vessel of Brass, whose Cavity was an exact Inch, that I imploy'd to find out the weight of a Cubick Inch of Water; I made use of it on this occasion too: and found that, when it was carefully filled with such Oil of Turpentine, as we were wont to imploy about Hydrostatical Experi∣ments; the contained Liquor a∣mounted but to 221 Grains, and an Eighth (part of a Grain;) by which number the Difference of the weight Page  126 of a Solid in the Air, and in that Oil, being divided, the Quotient will give you the Solid Contents of the examined Body.
After so circumstantial an Ac∣count, as we have given, of the Way of Hydrostatically examining such floating Solids, as, like the Wood we imploy'd, are of a Texture at least moderately close; it may be sea∣sonable, to proceed to the mention of the Second sort of floating Bo∣dies, that I formerly told you might be proposed to be weigh'd in Wa∣ter: Namely, such as, by their Po∣rosity or Laxeness of Texture, are subject to imbibe too much of that Liquor; even in as little time as is necessary for the dispatch of the Ex∣periment.
*Mersennus (more briefly than clearly) proposes an Expedient in this case, which is to cover over the Body to be weigh'd in Water with Wax, Pitch, or some other Gluten, as he calls it, whose Specifick Weight in Water must be first known. But, Page  127 I take Bees-wax to be much prefe∣rable to the other Two. For Pitch is so apt to stick to Ones Hands or Cloathes, that 'tis troublesome to apply it, and very difficult to get it off: And as for Glues, most of them, especially the more common, are dis∣soluble in Water, and therefore not so fit for the purpose as Bees-wax, (for That, I presume, he means by Wax;) which has this Conveniency in it, that its Proportion to Wa∣ter being usually constant enough, and the Gravity of those two Bodies differing but little, one may more easily dispatch a good part of the Experiment; which is thus to be performed. Take the Solid (lighter than Water, that you would exa∣mine Hydrostatically, and having weigh'd it in the Air, over lay it carefully with a thin Coat of Bees-wax, so that no part of it may re∣main uncovered, or accessible to the Liquor. Then take also in the Air the Weight of the Wax you have imploy'd, and fasten to the Body Page  128 thus coated, a Plate of Lead, or Tin, heavy enough to make it sink, and observe the weight of the Aggre∣gate in Water. This done, sub∣stract the weight of as much Water, as is equal in Bulk to the Wax, and proceed with the rest, as is before taught. Mersennus declares this Practice by this Instance, if the Wax that invests the proposed Body be of ℥xxij in the Air, the Bulk of Water e∣qual to it will be ℥xxi; and therefore a Quantity of Water of ℥xxi, must be first taken away, or substracted, that the remaining Bulk, equal to the (immerst) Body, may, by its Gravity, shew the Gravity of the Body (pro∣posed,) as has before been said.
But, because the Way, above deli∣vered, can help us but to the know∣ledge of the Weight of the propo∣sed Body in Water; we must, to discover the Solid Content of it, pro∣ceed further than our Mersennus ena∣bles us to goe; and therefore we must divide the Weight of the So∣lid in Water, already found, by 256 Page  129 Grains, that by the help of the Quo∣tient we may obtain the Solid Con∣tents of the proposed Body.
I have sometimes (to add That upon the By,) thought of, and try'd, another Expedient, to hinder smaller Solids, whether lighter or heavier in Specie than Water, from imbibing the Ambient Liquor. In order to this, I first found the Weight of a Cubick Inch of Quicksilver, (which is not difficult to discover by its Pro∣portion to Water of the same Bulk.) And then we brought the Body to be measured, into a Vessel, whose Solid Contents were known before; and Thirdly, all that was not pos∣sessed by the firm Body, being filled with Quicksilver, 'twas easie e∣nough to know by the Difference in Weight of That Quicksilver, from the Weight of the Quicksilver, re∣quisite to fill the whole Vessel, to how much Quicksilver the environ'd Body was equal. And by this means, and the knowledge before gained of the Weight of a Cubical Inch of Page  130 Mercury, the Solid Contents of the Body proposed was not difficult to be obtained. But I forbear to give more than this Intimation of an Ex∣pedient, which, besides that it be∣longs properly to another Essay, is rather Mechanical than Hydrostati∣cal. And for the same reason, I for∣bear to set down one Way of mea∣suring the Contents of Irregular So∣lids, delivered in some Books of Pra∣ctical Geometry; and another, but yet unpublished, Way, differing e∣nough from the Former, that tends to the same purpose.
CHAP. XVI.
BUt, I perceive, that 'tis now more than time, that I should put an end to a Labour, that has, I fear, tyr'd you, because, I am sure, it has tyr'd me. And yet I dare not conclude this Tract with∣out briefly answering a couple of Page  131 Questions, that, I foresee, may justly enough be asked me by a Peruser of the foregoing Essay.
And first, I presume it may be de∣manded, Whether I have proposed the best Ways that can be thought of, to examine Bodies Hydrostatically? To which Question I answer, that, upon divers Considerations, some of which have been mentioned here and there in the Body of the foregoing Essay, I did not think my self obliged solicitously to Invent, or propound, new Instru∣ments for the Hydrostatical Examen of Bodies. For tho' I am not Igno∣rant, that divers more curious and Artificial ways of finding out their Weight in Water, or their Solid Contents by it, may be devised by Persons more skilful and sagacious than I. And tho' also I think it not unlikely, that, when the Utility of such Practices comes to be taken no∣tice of, Artificial Instruments will be found out to Facilitate, or other∣wise Improve them: Yet, I thought it became me at first to propound Page  132 only the more simple Ways of Opera∣ting, as the most likely to invite the Generality of those, for whose sake this Essay is made publick; and to require, for the main part of our Ex∣periments, only the Use of the Bal∣lance, as an Instrument easily pro∣curable, and already, for other pur∣poses, in most Mens hands, without mentioning, at this time, any more Artificial Instruments; tho' some of them are such, as I have long since not only had thoughts of, but, for my own Uses, practised; which In∣timation may be countenanced, if it were needful, by the mention of that little Instrument, for distin∣guishing between true and counter∣feit Guineas, or the like Pieces of coyn'd Gold, by the help of Water; which was several Years ago pub∣lished in the Philosophical Transacti∣ons, and has since (without stay∣ing for my Improvements of it) been made Use of by Some, and usurp'd by Others. But of such things, no more in this place.
Page  133Having answered the First Que∣stion, it remains, that I consider the Second, wherein tho' I shall aim at Brevity as much, as in the for∣mer, yet I fear, I shall not be able to discuss it in as few Lines, as I did That. I presume then, it will be asked, What Credit may be given to the Estimates of the Weight, and Proportions of Bodies, obtained by Hy∣drostatical Tryals?Since, we see, that tho' Mathematicians, not knowing, or not applying, our Observation a∣bout the Specifick Gravity of Rock-Chrystal, and the Nature of Oil, especially that of Turpentine, have given us but the Proportions of Me∣tals, and some very few other Fa∣miliar Bodies, as the Loadstone, Wax, Hony, Oil and Wine; yet those few that have not transcrib'd from one another, differ in the Ta∣bles, they have left us, of the Com∣parative weight of those few Bo∣dies.
This Question is so comprehen∣sive, that, I think, it cannot well re∣ceive Page  134 a single Answer; and therefore, I shall offer Two things to be consi∣dered about it.
And first, I freely acknowledge, that there is no exact Uniformity in the Observations delivered about the weight of Metals, a•d the other Bo∣dies newly nam'd, among the few Authors that have written of this Subject; and there would proba∣bly have been yet more Difference in their Accounts, if some, even of those Writers, had not avowedly made use, to their purposes, of as much as they thought fit of the Ta∣bles of Ghetaldus.
Nay, I shall not think it very strange, if I find, that the Experi∣ments of the same Man, made at di∣stant times, and in other differing Circumstances, should not all of them exactly agree. For I have already noted, and, I think, in more places than One, that there will scarce be found so great an Uniformity in Qualities, and particularly in Spe∣cifick weight, among Bodies of the Page  135 same Kind or Denomination, as there is generally presum'd to be. There may be also some Difference, tho' but little, betwixt the Waters Men employ, especially if the Air be at One time (as in July) intensely hot, and at Another (as in January) ex∣ceeding Cold. The Difference also of Degrees of Goodness of the Bal∣lances, Men employ about nice Ex∣periments, is not altogether incon∣siderable. But there is a thing of greater Moment than this, towards the hindering Hydrostatical Experi∣ments, and even Statical Ones them∣selves, from being so accurate, as those, that are not versed in such Matters, may require. The thing I mean, is, the Difficulty of finding an exact Uniformity in Weights of the same Denomination, which, for that Reason, are vulgarly supposed to be exactly equal; But, to know how far this Supposition is to be re∣ly'd on, it may at present suffice to set down some Passages of a Mathe∣matician justly famous for his dili∣gence, Page  136 and who has made it his par∣ticular Work to examine these Mat∣ters scrupuolusly. The first Passage, I shall allege out of his Writings, shall be the short Account he gives of ma∣ny Tryals he made of natural Grains, whence all sorts of weights have been deduced.*Cùm (saith he) om∣nia grana, vel semina, quae reperiri so∣lent in atriis venalibus Lutetiae, ad Stateram expendissem, vixque granum ullum inter ejusdem speciei grana grano alteri exacte respondisset, in incertis ludere nolui. The same Author in∣forms us, that the RomanGrains dif∣fer from the French Grains; since, as, he observes, 688 Grains of the former sort, are Equiponderant but to 576 Grains of the later sort. And he subjoyns, that, whilst he was wri∣ting these things, there was found by the more exact weights of the Mint, an Error in the former Estimate, of at least half a Grain in 36 Grains.
And elsewhere he gives notice, that, by two Relations, sent him from Page  137Rome, about the Number of Grains,* contained in a Roman Ounce, it ap∣pear'd, that even that Number vari∣ed, since One of those Relations re∣ckoned 612 Grains in an Ounce, whereas the other allowed it but 576 Grains. And yet this I do not wonder at, because I have my self found it so difficult in Practice, to get and keep Weights (for, as little as this is wont to be suspected, the the very Air may, in time, a little alter them,) as exact, as I desired, that I left off the hopes of it. And one Remark, tho' commonly over∣looked, I think too considerable to be here omitted. For,* whereas the accurate Ghetaldus's Tables of the Weight of Metals, and some few other Bodies, in reference to one ano∣ther, are looked upon as the most Au∣thentick that have been published & are accordingly made the most use of: 'Tis certain, that the Weights he employ'd are not divided, as Ours are. For, tho' indeed according to him, Page  138 as well as with us, the Ounce con∣sists of Four and twenty Scruples; yet the Scruple, which with us is di∣vided but into 20 Grains, he divides into 24. But to return to Mersennus, a while after he had told us of the Difference between his repeated Tryals, and Those of other Men, in determining the Weight of a certain Body, he has this Passage; which shews, that he was not over-con∣fident of the Preciseness of all his own Determinations. Cum autem (saith he) pag. 37. lib. 16. Dixi, Chelin•m, unde∣cim dici denariorum, credunt tamen alii decem dunt axat, nil assero.
Having gone thorough the First part of my Answer, to the Second Query above proposed, it remains, that I proceed to the Other part; which perhaps will not need more than the following Reflection.
I consider then, that tho' it be granted, that Hydrostatical Expe∣riments are not always either singly accurate, or exactly agreeable among Page  139 themselves; yet they may well be, both accurate enough to be of very good Use, especially in Practice; and less remote from being quite accu∣rate, than any other Ways that have been hitherto known to be Practised, of determining the Proportions of Bodies in point of Weight and Bulk, and of measuring the Solid Con∣tents of stable Bodies, whether hea∣vier in Specie than Water, or ligh∣ter.
The First part of this Reflection may be deduced, as a Corollary from, or at least confirmed by, the greatest part of the foregoing Essay. And indeed, as little Skill as I have in Hydrostaticks, I would not be debar∣red from the Use of them, for a con∣siderable Sum of Money; it having already done me acceptable Service, and on far more occasions, than I my self at first expected; especially in the Examen of Metals and Mine∣ral Bodies, and of several Chymical Productions. And I have been able Page  140 more than once or twice, to unde∣ceive Artists and other Experimen∣ters, that, bona fide, believed they had made, or were Possessors of, Luna fixa, (as they call it) and other valuable things: And to make a good Judgment of the Genuineness or Fal∣sity, and the Degrees of Worth, or Strength, in their kind, of divers ri∣cher or poorer Metalline Mixtures, and other Bodies, (some Solid, and some Liquid,) whose fair Appea∣rances might otherwise have much puzzled, if not deceived, me.
But of This more may be found in another Paper. For I must hasten to the Second part of our designed Reflection, by representing, That our Hydrostatical Methods of disco∣vering the Weights and Bulks of Bodies, tho' they be not Mathema∣tically accurate, yet they are less re∣mote from being so, than any Way of Mensuration of Bodies, (especi∣ally such little Ones, as we usually have need to examine on the ac∣count Page  141 of the Materia Medica,) by the Geometrical Instruments, that are hitherto known to be Practised; or, by the Way,* whereby the Tabula Coitionis & Expansionis Materiae per Spatia in Tangibilibus, &c. was fra∣med by the renowned Sir Francis Bacon; whose judicious Reflections up∣on the Rarity and Density of Bodies, such as their measures are delivered in that Table, do sufficiently manifest, as the Philosophical Genius of the Au∣thor, so the Utility that may be de∣rived from even such Determinati∣ons of the Bulks and Weights of Bo∣dies, as fall short enough of being accurate.
I might here relate, that, to con∣vince some curious Persons, how much Hydrostaticks may be made serviceable to as accurate Mensura∣tions, as ought to be expected in Physical Experiments; I desired a Virtuoso, First, to put together two Lumps of Metal (viz. of Tin, and of Lead) in a certain Proportion, Page  142 that he was to conceal from me, but to set down in Writing to prevent Mistakes. Then I desired him to melt the Metals (whose respective Spe∣cifick Gravities I knew before) into one Mass, and give me that Mass. And Thirdly, I weigh'd it carefully in Water; and did also Algebraically examine it. Which being done, I told him, that the Lead, he had im∣ploy'd, amounted to such a Weight, and the Tin to such another; which being compared with the Quantities he had committed to Paper, the Dif∣ference was found to be little more than one Grain, and this it self pro∣bably proceeded from some scarce avoidable Imperfection in the melt∣ing, pouring out, &c. of the given Bodies. But because specious Arith∣metick was employ'd in this Work, (to which, yet it was not absolute∣ly necessary,) I shall lay no Stress upon it; because, if I mistake not, the past Discourse may suffice to give the Hydrostatical Ways, of Men∣suration Page  143 of Bodies, a preference to their Competitors; and may keep it from being presumptuous, to say, that they may be received as the best for Practice, till some other more ac∣curate, and yet as firmly grounded, and as Practicable, Ways of accom∣plishing the same purposes, shall be propos'd.

I Know there is a greater Number of different kinds of Fossiles, than Those that are yet known to belong to the Materia Medica. And, I con∣fess, that the Persons, which the fol∣lowing Paper is chiefly designed to assist, are those that explore Minerals with an Aim not at Health, but at Profit. But yet I was content, that the en∣suing Discourse should accompany the foregoing Essay, as a kind of Ap∣pendix to it, because many of the Sub∣jects, about which both Tracts are con∣versant, are the same; and the Fun∣damental Observation, (viz. about the Specifick Gravity of Chrystal or Mar∣ble,) and the Hydrostatical Way of ap∣plying it, in Explorations, is the same Page  148 in both: and also, (and indeed, chiefly,) because I was made to believe, that it might, especially at this Season, be grateful, and not unuseful, to divers Searchers after profitable Minerals.
This Paper (as the Inscription in∣timates,) was designed to be sent to the Learned Secretary of the Royal So∣ciety; when it was expected, that he would begin again to publish Monthly the Philosophical Transactions, that had been long suspended, and as long desired by the Curious. But since some Accidents have occurr'd, that occa∣sion a further delay of their Publica∣tion, it was not thought fit, this Paper (after having been long already) should be any longer confin'd to my Closet. 'Tis true, that this Dis∣course, containing but an Application of an Hydrostatical Experiment; I am far, as I ought to be, from proposing it as a Treatise of the Docimastical Art; whose grand Instrument is, the Fire Skilfully manag'd. For which reason I have foreborn to set down in this Page  149 Paper, any of the Flux Powders, or other Ways of Examining Ores, or of Reducing Them, or other Fossiles, to Metals or Regulus's; that either Say-Masters are wont to employ, or I have devised, or try'd, upon Minerals. But, this notwithstanding, our unpractised Way of Estimating Ores, may not be useless; and for that reason, will not perhaps be unwelcome to some, that Love Mineralogy, much better than they Ʋn∣derstand it: Especially coming forth at a time, when many industrious Persons of this Nation are excited to look after profitable Minerals, by the Repeal (that has been made, since our Appendix was written,) of a discouraging Act of Parliament, made in the Reign of Henry the IV. And tho' our Hydro∣statical Way, of Estimating Fossiles, will not determine how Rich or Poor they are in this or that particular Metal; yet, (as is intimated at the beginning in the ensuing Paper,) it it may, on many occasions, serve to k•ep Page  150 those that are Venturous, and not Skil∣ful, from being deluded by Cheats, or from deluding themselves with ill∣grounded Expectations; which the Pro∣mising appearances of divers Fossiles, especially Marchasites, will temptingly Invite, but never Answer.

SECT. I.
Sir,
AT a time, wherein so many ingenious, or industrious,* Men appear very Solicitous to discover and to work Mines, both Here and in New England, and O∣thers of his Majesties American Co∣lonies; it will not, probably, be thought unseasonable, nor prove un∣welcome Page  152 to the Seekers of Subterraneal Treasures, if my desire to do them a piece of Service, make me borrow of a Paper, I long since wrote about some things relating to the Materia Medica,a few Paragraphs, that con∣tain a Way of Exploration of Mi∣nerals; which tho' it reaches but to One of their Qualities, will, perhaps, by reason, of the Considerableness of of This, keep, on certain Occasi∣ons, some Searchers after Mines from beginning chargeable Works, or prosecuting them with too great Expectations, which are usually fol∣low'd by proportionable Disappoint∣ments. And I make the less Scruple to suffer this Fragment to leave its Company, and present it self to you; because, after the misfortune, I have formerly signified to you, of the Loss and Spoiling of several of my Wri∣tings, I know not when, if ever, I may have Opportunity of Commu∣nicating to my Friends the Treatise, that these Paragraphs belong to.
Page  153That Part of the forementioned Treatise, that concerns my present purpose, is founded on an Experi∣ment, whereof what you are about to read, is One of the Applications.
I shall then succinctly inform you, that the Observation, whereon my Discourse was grounded, is double, as will by and by appear; and that the Rise of it, which will help to understand the Nature and Influences of it, was this. I thought fit, (for Reasons elsewhere given) to find out, what was the Specifick Gravity of a pure Stone, such as I supposed Chry∣stal or White Marble, or a Stony Isicle, to be; and found it by the Hy∣drostatical Way of Tryal, (doubt∣less not unknown to You,) that is delivered in the Essay called Medi∣cina Hydrostatica, whereof when you please, you may command a sight, to have to clear common Water, equal to it in Bulk, or Mag∣nitude, pretty near the Ratio, or Proportion of two and an half to one; or, which is somewhat more Page  154 obvious to conceive, as five to two. I said, pretty near, because 'tis not always exact, nor need be for our present purpose, but usually enough does somewhat rather exceed that Proportion than fall short of it; but that is so little, that it may, on all common Occasions, be safely enough neglected by a Mineralist: Tho', if one pleases, one may make use of the Proportion of 2 ¾ to 1, that is, of 11 to 4.
SECT. II.
THe Uses, that may be made to our present purpose of this Fundamental Observation, are ei∣ther of a more General, or of a more Particular, Nature.
As to the first of these; When my Intention is only to discover in ge∣neral, Whether a Fossile propound∣ed, or perhaps casually lighted on, may with probability be judged to Page  155 contain any Substance, either Metal∣line, or belonging to some Fossile of Affinity to a Metalline Nature; and also, Whether, in case the first Question be resolv'd in the Affirma∣tive, the proposed Body does, indefi∣nitely speaking, contain much, or but little, of the Metalline or other Adventitious Substance: When, I say, I would only make those General In∣quiries, I weigh the Body I would ex∣amine, first in Air, and then in Wa∣ter, and observe the Proportion in Specifick Gravity between them; and if I find it weigh either less, or but little more, than Chrystal or Marble of the same Bulk, I judge it unlikely to contain any Metalline Portion, considerable for its Quan∣tity. And if it weigh manifestly, or somewhat considerably, more than Marble or Chrystal, I guess, that, in Proportion to that Excess, it abounds, more or less, with a Metalline In∣gredient, or one or other of Affinity to a Metalline Nature.
Page  156To explain my self a little by two or three Examples; 'tis known, that the Magnet is vulgarly reckon'd amongst Stones, and its great Hard∣ness confirms Men in that Opinion. But having observed, that Load∣stones, especially those that come from some Places, that I elsewhere take notice of, seem to be apparently more ponderous than common Stones of the like Bulk; We weigh'd them in Air and Water, and found their Specifick Gravity, especially of some of them,* so far to exceed That of Chrystal or Marble, that it could not be difficult for us to conclude, that these Fossiles contained a not incon∣siderable Proportion of Metalline Matter, which, by Collateral Experi∣ments, delivered in another Paper, appear'd to be of a Martial or Fer∣ruginous Nature.
Emeri is a Fossile well known to ma∣ny Tradesmen, especially Armourers, & Gunsmiths, by whom 'tis common∣ly reputed a mere Stone. But finding that its Weight in Water conside∣rably Page  157 exceeded That of Chrystal of the same Bulk, since it was to that Liquor very near, as 4 to 1; I con∣jectured, that it contained a Metal∣line Substance, as afterward, by pro∣per Tryals, I found it to do. Upon the same ground, (its Weight in my hand) I concluded, that Lapis Hae∣matites, that is commonly sold in Shops, and, as its Name witnesseth, passes for a Stone, did not sparingly participate of a Metalline Ingredi∣ent; in prosecution of which Con∣jecture, I quickly thought on Ways whereby I discovered, that Iron or Steel was the Metal it contained.
And not to accumulate Instances in this place, I shall advertise you in general, (what perhaps may here∣after be found useful to several En∣quirers) that, upon the Grounds hi∣therto mentioned, I was invited to guess, that divers Bodies, that were little suspected to be of a Metalline, or Mineral, Nature, did really con∣tain a Portion of Substance that was so. And, I remember, in particular, Page  158 that, having met with Granats of several sizes, that were not Bohemian, but were found in other Parts of Europe, and some that I discovered in a kind of Talc, that was brought me from America; which Angular∣ly figured Stones, I suspected by their Weight to be Metallick, and found, by Hydrostaticks, to have a Specifick Gravity considerably sur∣passing That of Chrystal. Upon these Grounds, I say, I suppos'd them to participate, and that not very spa∣ringly, of a Metal, one or more; and, by other Ways of exploring, found, that I had guessed aright; since I was able, notwithstanding the great Compactness of such seem∣ingly vitreous Bodies, to discover there a Decomposition, and extract thence a Metallick Substance.
To these I might add other Fos∣siles, and some that were not, even by Men not unskilful, suspected to have any Metalline Ingredients. But I have not time to speak of Page  159 Them, and therefore shall proceed in the lately begun Discourse.
SECT. III.
TO illustrate then the general Observation, formerly laid down, and make it more distinct, I shall subjoyn the following Re∣marks.
First, I do not pretend, by this Way, to make any more than pro∣bable Conjectures and Estimates, a∣bout the Contents of the Bodies, I examine by it: But tho' the Esti∣mates, grounded on it, be not always True, yet they may be frequently Useful, as may be gathered from some of the subsequent Observati∣ons.
Secondly, If the Fossile proposed be lighter, especially if it be much lighter, than so much Chrystal, it is an almost certain Token, that it is Page  160 not a Metalline Ore. And this Ne∣gative use, if I may so call it, of our Hydrostaticks, may be more safely re∣lyed on, than the Affirmative Con∣sequences usually can be. Thus, when I find that Jet, tho' a Fossile dug up in Veins, especially in the Pyrenean Mountains, (as a Learned Man, whose Brother has there a Mine of Jet, assured me) has far less of Specifick Gravity, than Chrystal, I conclude it to be no Metalline Body. The like Inference I make, on the same ground, as to Fossile Amber or Suc∣cinum, Sulphur vive, and the Obser∣vation holds in common Sulphur, (clear or Semidiaphanous) Eng∣lish Talc, Venetian Talc, and some other firm Concretions, whether Brittle or not, that are dug out of the Earth. Among these, I think fit to mention particularly Black-Lead, lest the Name it bears, should de∣ceive Men into a Belief, that 'tis an Ore of that Metal. For having found its Weight, in reference to Water, to be but as 1 86/100 to 1. And, gather∣ing Page  161 from the Smalness of its Specifick Gravity, that it would prove to be very unlike our true common Lead Ores, I found, upon Tryal purpose∣ly made, that, 'twas a Mineral sui ge∣neris,and seemed, upon the score of more than one Quality, to be of kin to a sort of Talc, that I have met with.
Thirdly, We should distinguish between the several Uses, that Fossiles may be sought for, and exa∣mined, by Men of different Professi∣ons, or Designs. And therefore, if a Fossile be found to be somewhat, and yet but very little, heavier in Specie, than Chrystal or Marble; it may possibly have a Metalline or Mi∣neral Portion, which, tho' very small in quantity, may consist of such Efficacious parts, as may make it de∣serve the Esteem of a Jeweller, a Phy∣sician, or a Chymist. But if the Surplus of Specifick Gravity be in∣considerable, the Fossile it self will be so too to a Mineralist, that seeks not to gratifie his Curiosity, or make a Page  162 good Medicine, but to fill his Purse. For the Charge and Trouble of working a Fossile, so poor in Metal∣line Substance, will probably either exceed the Profit, or keep it from being considerable; whereas, if the Specifick Gravity do much exceed That of Marble or Chrystal, it may give good hopes of proving a Sub∣ject profitable to be wrought on.
Fourthly, But, here I must give notice, that, tho' for the most part, the great Ponderosity of a Fossile proceeds from a Portion of some Metalline Substance, more strictly so called, that is imbody'd with the o∣ther part of the Concrete; yet this alone is indeed a certain Sign, that the Fossile is not a mere Stone, but is not alone a sure Sign, that the Mineral Portion is properly Metal∣line; and therefore, where there is just Cause of doubt, 'tis best to en∣deavour by some Collateral Signs to resolve it. The Reason, why I thought fit to give you this Admonition, is, that, besides Metalline Ores more pro∣perly Page  163 so called, there are other Fos∣siles, which some call Semi-Metals, others Media Mineralia, and others a∣gain give other Appellations to; which Fossiles, tho' of Affinity to Metals, are wont to be distinguished from true Metalline Ores; such (Fossiles) as are (that I may here name the principal of them) Antimony, Bismuth, (usually in our Shops called Tin-glass) Lapis Calaminaris, and Pyrites, commonly called Marcasites, and vulgarly, in English, Vitriol Stones.) But there will not perhaps occur many Cases, wherein it will be necessary to have recourse to Collateral Signs, to dis∣cern, Whether the Mineral Portion of a Fossile, be, in a stricter Sense, of a Metalline Nature, or not: For these Semi-Metals that I speak of, are most commonly found either in Veins, or in Masses, or great Lumps of their respective Kinds; and easily discover, to one that considers them with so much as a moderate measure of At∣tention and Skill, what Species of Fossiles they belong to. I have in∣deed Page  164 from Devonshire received a Lump of Matter, which the Owner of the Mine, not knowing what to make of, desired my Opinion of, wherein I found some Antimony mixt with Lead, which was the Predomi∣nant Body. But such Mixtures oc∣cur not often enough, at least here in England, to keep our Way of Estimating ponderous Fossiles from being, on most occasions, useful.
SECT. IV.
FIfthly, 'Twill be almost necessa∣ry to give you notice in this place, that there may be a two-fold Estimate made of the Specifick Gra∣vity of Ores; One, when the Metal∣line Body proposed is weigh'd in its natural State, that is, as 'tis taken out of the Earth, accompanied with the Sparr, or other Heterogeneous matter, that firmly adheres to it, (only the loose Earth being first wa∣shed off:) and the Other, after it has Page  165 been beaten small and separated from stony, and other Heterogeneous, Sub∣stances, by the help of Water; where being skilfully agitated, there is easily discovered a notable Dis∣parity in Weight between these, and the Genuine, or Metalline, parts of the Ore, which being thus sever'd from the rest, are called, for instance, washed Tin, if afforded by a Vein of that Metal. And sometimes also 'tis very Useful, if not Necessary, to pre∣pare the Ore by rosting it, (as they speak) once, or oftner, or by keep∣ing it several hours in a competently strong Fire, as is usually enough done to prepare Copper-Ore, especially if it be stubborn. I have distinctly mentioned these Two States, wherein the Weight of an Ore may be estimated; because, I have obser∣ved, that in several Cases 'twill much import the Experimenter to distin∣guish them carefully. For several Ores, which, in their natural State, have too little of Specifick Gravity, to make them judg'd worth the Page  166 Charge of being wrought, may yet, being prepared by Water and Fire, afford a Metalline Portion so heavy in Specie, that it may give fair hopes of containing in it some Portion of Silver, or of Gold; and, in that case, a small Proportion of the Former, and a much smaller of the Later, would render the Ore considerable, and make it pretty Rich; tho' not in reference to the quantity it yeilds of the predominant Metal, as Lead, Tin, or Copper; yet in a more ab∣solute Sense, as it may better recom∣pense the Charges of him that shall work it. Which brings into my mind, that sometime agoe a piece of Lead Ore, then brought out of Ire∣land, being offered me to judge of; I found it so light in the Lump, that I thought it not at all worthy to be wrought for Lead; but afterwards upon Tryal it appeared to be, tho' very poor in that Metal, yet so well stor'd with Corpuscles of Silver, that I scrupled not to incourage the Owner to bestow Pains and Cost upon it.
Page  167
SECT. V.
BUt there is one Kind of Mine∣rals, that I have observed to impose on Men so often, that I think it necessary to take a particular no∣tice of them in this place. For, not to mention Examples, that I might draw out of the Books of Travel∣lers and Navigators, I have met with I know not how many, that have built great hopes, and some, (which is worse) that have been at Char∣ges upon those illusory Expectati∣ons of great matters from Marcasites. And, I remember, I have had sent me, or brought me, not only from Places nearer home, but from hotter and col∣der Countries of the Indies themselves, Fossiles, whereof I was earnestly de∣sired to give my Opinion, that I found to be but Marcasites: And ma∣ny of these Fossiles having two Qua∣lities, that make them very fit to Page  168 delude the vulgar, and the unskilful, namely, first, a Multitude of shining streaks, or other glistering parts usu∣ally of a Colour near enough to That of Gold, and sometimes to That of Sil∣ver; and then, a Ponderousness usu∣ally not inferior, at least, to that of true Metalline Ores; Marcasites, I say, being thus fitted to delude the unskilful, I have had much ado to un∣deceive some, that brought or sent me them from America, of the plea∣sing Confidence they had entertain∣ed, that these promising Fossiles were Lumps of rich Ore of Gold, or Silver. Wherefore since their Pon∣derousness (which is the Criterion of Minerals, I am now treating of,) is One of the Two chief Things that delude so many, I think it expedi∣ent, to subjoyn some few, but vari∣ous, Instances of the Specifick Gravity of Marcasites, whereby it may appear, that some of them are, Bulk for Bulk, far more ponderous than divers true Metalline Ores, that I have try'd, have been found to be. And indeed Page  169 this great Ponderosity has several times invited me, before I made any Artificial Tryal of propounded Fos∣siles, and sometimes before I took them out of the Bags or Papers to look on them, to judge, tho' perhaps to the Surprize of those that brought them, that they were not true Ores, but Marcasites. And, because this Mistake is speciously grounded, and has deceived many, whereof some have undertaken Voyages betwixt Europe and the Indies, upon confi∣dence of the value of these glistering Stones; I shall decline a little the Me∣thod of this Paper, which confines me to the Hydrostatical Way of ex∣ploring Minerals, to advertise those whom it may concern, that they may easily try almost any Stone, that, by its great Weight and Lustre, they suspect to be a Marcasite, if they put it, either within a Crucible, or, without One, into a well-kindled Fire, and blow now and then upon it with a pair of Bellows. For, by this means, the Sulphur, wherewith Page  170Marcasites are wont to abound, (so that I remember, that even by Destil∣lation in a close Vessel, I had ℥iv of good Brimstone, like the vulgar, out of lbiij of the Stones) will take Fire, and burn with a Flame for the most part blew, like that of com∣mon Sulphur. And, if when it cea∣ses to flame and smoak, you take it out of the Fire and let it cool, you will find it deprived of all the gau∣dy appearance of rich Metal it had before, and turned to a brittle blac∣kish Substance, differing enough from That of a Metalline Ore, more strictly so called.These last words I add, be∣cause, in a lax Sense, 'tis easie to shew, that Marcasites, at least those that I have tryed, may be looked upon as a kind of Metalline Bodies. For, be∣sides that I have found divers of them to contain Particles of Copper, I found all, that I purposely exami∣ned, to contain, and some of them plentifully enough, Corpuscles of Iron or Steel, as plainly appeared, when, after the newly mentioned Page  171 Calcination, (for with crude Mar∣casites I found not the following Tryal to succeed) I applyed to the pulverized Remains a vigorous Load-stone; to which great multi∣tudes of Martial Corpuscles quickly adher'd. And, I remember, I found in a Catalogue of the Fossiles of Mis∣nia, published by the experienced Kentmannus, that, under the Head or Title of Pyrites,he brings in seve∣ral Marcasites, whereof some con∣tained Copper, others Silver, others Gold, and others both the last nam∣ed Metals; which brings into my mind, that, having presented, among other English Minerals, a curiously shaped, and very fine Marcasite, to a Virtuoso, that is now Overseer of one of the Emperors best Mines; He quickly examined it by a peculiar Way, not known to me, hoping to find in it some Gold or Silver; but, instead of that, obtain'd a Portion of running Mercury, which he was pleased to present me, and which, I presume, I may have yet by me.
Page  172Tho' I thought it needful to give the foregoing Caution about Mar∣casites, for the Reasons before ex∣prest, yet my Design is, only to keep the less skilful from being deluded by their promising appearance. For otherwise I do not deny, but that 'tis possible for a skilful Artist, to make (at least of some sorts) of them a gainful use; either by fixing the Volatile Gold or Silver, that may be found in some of them; or, by graduating Silver, by their means; or, perhaps by some other Ways, that I can but guess at. But (to add That on this occasion,) that, for which I much more value Marcasites, is, That (NB) somewhat more than bare Conjectures make me think, that, being dexterously handled, and perhaps even without Additions, they may afford very noble, as well as uncommon, Medicines; and par∣ticularly in Continual Feavers, tho' their Operation be usually scarce sen∣sible, but by their good Effects.
Page  173
SECT. VI.
ON this occasion, I must not for∣bear to give an Advertise∣ment, that may be of good Use to divers Examiners of Ores, espe∣cially such, as are Novices in the Art of reducing them. And it is This, that, as to many, who make Tryals of Ores, tho' they much value their own Flux-Powders, or Those that are cry'd up by others, yet they com∣monly act, as if they expected no∣thing from those that they prefer, but that they should more than O∣thers facilitate the Fusion of the Ores; as that which being once done, the Metalline part will be separated by its own Weight, or, as it were, Spon∣taneously. But yet, having purpose∣ly examined the Matter more nicely, and compared the Quantities of Me∣tal, that we obtain'd from two Por∣tions of equal Weight of the same Page  174 Ore, we found that those Proportions did very considerably differ, tho' that which yeilded least Metal was flux'd down with a Fondant (as the French compendiously call, what Our men, af∣ter the Germans, call a Flux-Powder,) that is dear enough, and not undeser∣vedly esteemed, when such Ores are to be handled. And I little doubt, but that from other Metalline Ores, a greater Portion of pure Metal may be obtained by some, but little im∣ployed or known, Fondants, and per∣haps cheap Ones too, than by Others that are much more in use and fa∣mous; Of which I may elsewhere give some Instances: Now, One that first occurs to my Memory, was af∣forded me, by two equally heavy Portions of the same Lead Ore de∣void of Sparr; whereof One, being reduced with a due Weight of Ni∣tre and Tartar fulminated together, afforded much less of Malleable Lead, than was obtained by means of half or a quarter of the Quantity of Fi∣lings of Mars, which, for Tryals sake, Page  175 I then imployed on the Other; to shew, how much better a Reductive of that kind of Ore, that Metalline Flux was, than even a sharp and fiery fixt Salt.
And yet, (to give you an Instance in a much more precious Mineral than Lead Ore,) I shall add, that having, for Curiosities sake, try'd some Ounces of good native Cinna∣bar finely pulverized; one half with a fixt Alcaly of Tartar, and the o∣ther with a different Flux-powder, we obtained from the first Parcel twice as much Mercury, as we did from the other half, destilled with ano∣ther fixt Alcaly; even tho' it were of a Mineral Nature.
Some Observations about Native Gold. SECT. VII.
GOld, being by far the most No∣ble, and Precious, of Metals,* it may be ill taken, if I should here leave the Ore or Mineral, that af∣fords Page  176 it altogether unmentioned; and therefore, tho' I have but Two, or Three, Observations pertinent to my present Subject, to offer about it, yet I think it may not be useless to say somewhat of that Ore in this place.
I know, there are many learned Men, and even Chymists, that think, there are no such things as Gold Mines, properly so called. And, I confess, that I my self was long kept from being confident of the Affirma∣tive. And I was induced to this Dif∣fidence by considering, that tho' ha∣ving had the Honour for divers Years to be a Member of his Majesties Council for Foreign Plantations▪ I had the opportunity to converse with a considerable Number of Navigators, and other great Travellers, and with divers Persons, that had setled them∣selves in the Indies, I made it more than once my business to inquire, not, Whether they knew of any Gol∣den Mines in the popular sense of the word, for, I knew, that there are in Page  177Hungary, Macedonia, and some o∣ther Countries, Mines that afford Gold enough to deserve to be wrought for it: but▪ Whether there are any real Mines, or Veins, whereof Gold is manifestly the predominant Metal. Having, I say, proposed to many this Question, I was answer∣ed, That some of them indeed had heard of such Mines, but none of them had ever seen any. But after∣wards I saw some Ore that I judg'd true, that was presented to his Ma∣jesty (Charles the Second; and I also received from an unknown Virtuoso, residing in the East Indies, together, with a very civil Letter (which I wish∣ed had been more Historical and less Complemental,) among other less valuable pieces of Ore, One in whose Clefts, and a little beyond them, there appear some Lumps, wherein by their Colour, and other Signs, 'tis so apparent, that Gold is the predo∣minant Metal, that I little doubt, but that, if I would spoil the Lump by breaking the Spar, I should find Page  178 these Metalline Protuberances Mal∣leable, without the help of the Fire.
But being unwilling to destroy the Entireness of it, I shall make only a few, and short, Remarks about this Ore.
The biggest Piece, and that which was best furnished with Metalline parts, being about an Ounce and a quarter in Weight, contained so great a Proportion of Spar, in refe∣rence to the Metal, that its Weight to an equal Bulk of Water was but as 2 91/100 to 1.
But somewhat to compensate this Smalness of the Metalline Portion; That, that was of it, seemed to be all Gold, there being no Sign of any other Metal in that Lump of Ore, nor in some lesser Ones that I recei∣ved with it.
The Spar (as our Mine-men use to call that stony Matter, in which the true Ore is immediately lodged,) did not look like the Spar of Lead Ore, or that of any other of our English Metals that I have seen, but seemed at Page  179 first view to be a kind of white Mar∣ble with a dash of Yellow.
And upon Tryal, I found it to differ more from the Spar of Lead Ore, which, with us, is usually White, and and almost Semi-diaphanous than in the Colour. For, whereas our Spar of Lead Ore is oftentimes so soft or tender, that it may easily enough be cut with a knife, we found the Sparry Portion of our Gold Ore to be a Solid stone, and that so hard, that, being struck with a piece of Steel, it would yield Sparks of Fire.
Whereas also I found, that the Spar of Lead Ore would be easily enough, and in a short time, (as a∣bout a quarter of an hour) calcin'd to a kind of Lime; our Golden Spar, tho' kept some hours red hot in a Crucible, did not appear to be at all calcined. And whereas I had former∣ly observ'd, that I could easily dis∣solve the Spar of Lead Ore in some Acid Menstruums and even in destilled Vinegar it self, I did not find, that our Page  180 Golden Spar, tho' kept divers hours in stronger Menstruums, as Spirit of Salt, Aqua Fortis, and Aqua Regis, was dissolved or manifestly wrought upon by any of them; as if it were of a glassy Nature, as well as of a very hard One.
A piece of Spar, that had scarce any Gold at all that could be discer∣ned, being Hydrostatically exami∣ned, was in Specifick Gravity to Wa∣ter, as 2 65/100 to 1. which Ponderosity does but very little exceed That of white Marble, or That of some good Spar of Lead Ore that was compared with it.
If I had received a greater Quanti∣ty of Gold Ore, I should have given a less imperfect Account of this Sub∣ject. But these Notes, such as they are, may, perchance, not be unwel∣come to some of those many Eng∣lish and other Searchers for Mines, that have never seen true Gold Ore, or have not had Liberty to make any Tryals upon it, and yet are in Search of Gold Mines, especially in Ja∣maica,Page  181 where, if I much mis-remem∣ber not, the * inquisitive Gentleman, that conquer'd it for the English, told me, at his return thence, that the Spanish Governour of the Island, when his Prisoner, confessed to him, That there was Mineral Gold, tho' the Spaniards did not dig deep for it for want of Workmen.
SECT. VIII.
BUt by the mention I have made of the true Ore of Gold, I would not discourage any from seek∣ing for that rich Metal in the Veins of some other Metals; because, in di∣vers of these, I know it may some∣times be found blended with predo∣minant Minerals. This may appear by those Hungarian Copper Mines of Cremnitz,* whence a considera∣ble Quantity of Gold is yearly ob∣tained. I have elsewhere also taken Page  182 notice, that I have seen an English Tin-Ore, Part of which I presented to the King, wherein there lay, in little Cells, a good number of small Leaves or Chips of Gold, which I saw there with pleasure. And tho' the Tin-men, not being able to separate them with Profit, usually melted both the Metals together, and sold the Product for mere Tin; yet an ex∣perienced Gentleman, who was Owner of the Mine, assured me, that One of his Workmen, who had ma∣ny little Children, imployed them with good Profit, to pick the Gold with their small Fingers out of the skilfully broken Ore. And tho' Lead-Mines be looked upon, as those, which the Matter, whereof Gold is made, is seldomest found to be near, and does as it were avoid; yet, there is a place in Scotland, (whose Name I remem∣ber not,) where, over a Lead Mine, upon or near the Surface of the Ground, they oftentimes find Grains or bigger pieces of Native Gold with∣out Spar; some of which by the in∣genious Page  183 Owners favour, I was Master of, and thought sometimes worthy of being presented to that curious Exa∣miner of Ores, his Highness Prince Rupert. And still I have one bit of Native Metal by me, which, if I much mistake not, I had from the same place: which Fossile, tho' I found it Hydrostatically (because being Native I would not melt it) not to be, as the Owner suppos'd, pure Gold; yet Gold is the predomi∣nant Metal in it, and the piece weighs forty odd Grains.
Since I wrote the last foregoing Lines, I have, in an old Collection of my Notes, found Three; whereof the First is thus set down, A Grain of Scotch Gold, such as Nature had made it, without any adhering Stone or Spar, weighed ʒiij + 21 Grains: The Se∣cond thus, Another Grain of the same Gold, that had here and there some little Stone or Spar sticking to it, and partly inclosed in it, weighed ʒiij + 3 Grains; So that the Heteroge∣neous Substance being, according to Page  184 my Estimate, abated, it weighed about ʒiij: And the Third is subjoyned in these Terms, A Grain of Scotch Gold weighed in Air, 43 Grains; in Water. 39 ½ Grains: Diff•r. 3• ½ Propor. 12 •/• to 1.
This Lightness of a Yellow Me∣tal (heavier than Brass or Silver) deserves a Reflection; but I cannot stay to make it.
It several times happens, that, a∣mong the lesser Grains of Gold, that are more properly called Sand-Gold, there are found pieces, some of which I have seen, that are singly big e∣nough to be tyed about with an Horse∣hair, and so weighed in Water, as Lumps of Ore of other Metals are wont to be. And to such bigger Frag∣ments of Gold, 'tis manifest, by what has been already delivered, that our Hydrostatical Way of exploring may be usefully applyed. For since, ac∣cording to the famous and diligent Mersennus, and some esteemed Wri∣ters, pure Gold is to Water of the same Bulk, as (about) 18 to 1; and Page  185 by my Examen of very fine Gold, I found, that it equals about Nine∣teen times the Weight of as much Water, (I say, about, because I unhappily lost the exactest of my Tryals upon Gold, among those made upon the other Metals in a most ex∣quisite Ballance) as is equal to it in Bulk; it will readily appear, Whe∣ther the Fragment propos'd be per∣fectly pure or not. For, if its Weight amount to near Nineteen times as much Water in Quantity, we may conclude it to be unallayed; and, as it wants less or more of this Pondero∣sity, we may conclude it to be more or less pure.
SECT. IX.
'TIs known, that, since we be∣gan effectually to cultivate the African Trade, it frequently brings into these Parts, besides things of less value, considerable Quantities of what, from the most usual Size of it, Page  186 is by many called Sand-Gold; but which, by reason of the very une∣qual Bulks of the Grains, may per∣haps justly be called Fragments of Gold; since being brought from the Maritime parts, where no Mines of Gold are yet found, they seem to have been broken off and washed away from hidden Veins by the violence of Waters, that, having carried them as far as they were able, left them a Prey to Men. Now, (because that un∣less it be perhaps brought by, or for, some Virtuoso) there is scarce any Gold that comes into Europe in Lumps, under the form of Ore; but a great deal that is brought from Guinea, (and those other parts of Africk, which, for that reason, are comprized under the Name of the Golden Coast) in the Form chiefly of Sand or Gra∣vel, grosser or smaller, and partly also of less minute Pieces; it may conduce to the scope of these Papers to take notice, that, in making E∣stimates of the Genuineness, and the degrees of Purity of these native Page  187 Fragments of Gold, our Hydrosta∣cal Way of exploring may be of no small use.
For first, when we have once dis∣covered the Proportion between pure or exquisitely refined Gold, and Wa∣ter equal to it in Bulk; (which Pro∣portion I have lately given exactly enough, for our present purpose,) tis easie, by our Hydrostatical Method, to examine the Fineness of any other Gold proposed; so, at least, as to know, whether it be perfectly Fine; and if it be not, whether it do con∣siderably fall short of perfect Fine∣ness. But since of this I elsewhere treat, I think it more proper to ob∣serve in this place, that when once a Man has found the true Specifick Gravity of a parcel of Sand-Gold, (smaller or courser,) whose Degree of Fineness he knows by Collateral Tryals, or some other Means, (what∣ever they be) He may (as was for∣merly noted when I spoke of Metal∣line Ores,) take this Specifick Gra∣vity for a Standard, with relation Page  188 to which, he may make his Estimates of the Fineness of other parcels of the like native Gold, that he is concern∣ed to buy, or to examine. And, by this means, he may oftentimes pre∣vent that chief Fraud of the Negroes, whereof several Traders to the Gol∣den Coast are not a little apprehen∣sive; as being in danger to be much damnified by it. For they complain, that, tho' the Blacks be otherwise, for the most part, but a dull sort of People; yet they have often made a shift to cheat the Traders, by clan∣destinely mixing, with the right Sand-Gold, Filings of Copper, or rather of Brass, whose Colour does so re∣semble that of Gold, that the Fraud is not easily discerned. And in the Account of a late Voyage, made by the French, to the Coast of Africk, to Trade especially for Gold, 'tis ac∣knowledged, that the Officers were egregiously cheated by the Blacks, who, instead of paying them for the Wares they brought, with Powder of true Gold, gave them Powder of Page  189 Brass, or gilt Copper, which those that were not accustomed to make Tryal of, are, as the Relater complains, such Wares, in a scarce evitable dan∣ger to be cheated: as these French men confess they were in one day to the worth of a thousand Crowns. But, in regard, that, as Tryal has informed me, Brass is not quite half so heavy as fine Gold of the same Bulk; if there be any considerable Quantity of Filings of Brass with the Gold; This Mix∣ture being put into such an Hydro∣statical Bucket, or wide-mouth'd Glass, as is mentioned in the Essay, will manifestly weigh less in Water, than if it were all Gold. And by comparing its Specifick Gravity, with that formerly found, to the Grain-Gold pitched upon for a Standard; the greater or lesser Decrement of the suspected Gold, will help to make an Estimate of the Quantity of Brass, mingled with the natural Gold.
Page  190
SECT. X.
BUt, tho' my present Undertaking do not oblige me to consider Sand-Gold, otherwise than Hydro∣statically; and, tho' it highly con∣cerns Merchants and Others, that deal in so rich a Commodity as Gold, and that is by so many studiously adul∣terated, to be furnisht with nice and trusty Ballances; yet, because divers Persons, especially Sea-men, that trade to the Gold Coast and other parts, where Sand-Gold is to be met with, do, (perhaps too often) with∣out being furnisht with good Scales and sufficient skill to use them, ven∣ture upon buying such precious Wares; it will not be to depart from my general and main Design, which is to serve the Publick; if I deviate a little from my Subject, and add to the Hydrostatical Way, late∣ly proposed, of examining Sand-Gold, Page  191 Two or Three Chymical ways to the same purpose. First, then, if he, that would purchase Sand-Gold, doubts, that there are Filings of Brass (or of Copper) mixt with it; in case he have Aqua Fortis at hand, he may quickly discover the Cheat, if there be any. For, 'tis known to Chymists, that Aqua Fortis will not work upon Gold, and therefore, if there be Fi∣lings of Brass mixt with it, the Ope∣ration of the Menstruum upon those, to∣gether with the Colour betwixt blew and green, it will thereby acquire, will discover the Deceit. But, because if Na∣ture hath mingled much Silver with the Gold, the Proof by Aqua Fortis will require Skill, and may puzzle those that want it; I shall add, that good Spirit of Urine may be substituted in its stead. For, I elsewhere shew, that 'twill readily work upon Filings of Copper or Brass in the Gold, and gain from them a fine blew Colour; and this being a Menstruum not cor∣rosive, like the other, but harmless to most Bodies, and a good Medicine Page  192 for human Bodies in several Diseases, (as the Jaundice, Pleurisies, some kind of Feavers, Coughs and Asthma's) may be fit to be carried about in Voyages, and to be preferr'd to Aqua Fortis. And, to make the Operation of this Liquor on Filings of Brass far more quick, than if the Solution be at∣tempted an ordinary Way; I thought upon the following Expedient. I took Filings of Brass, (and the like may be done with those of Copper,) amounting to the Weight but of Eight or Ten Grains, or perhaps less; and having with my Finger spread them somewhat thin upon a small piece of white Paper, I moistned them throughly with good Spirit of fermented (or putrified) Urine, (which will not dissolve Gold) that, by this means, the Air might pro∣mote the dissolutive Action of the Menstruum; which, accordingly, it did so well, that, to the surprize of the Beholders, there appeared, in less than a quarter of an hour, and some∣times in a few minutes, a manifest, if Page  193 not also a deep and pleasant, blew Colour upon the Paper, or on some of the Filings, (as both. Those that carry with them Spirit of Hartshorn, or such other Volatile Alcalys for Medicinal Uses, (as some modern Ship-Chirurgeons do;) may, for a need, imploy That instead of Spirit of Urine. Nay, one may for the same purpose make use of Urine it self ne∣ver destill'd, if it be Stale and Rank enough, (as it grows to be, sooner in hot Airs than in others:) Since ha∣ving for Tryals sake moistn'd with such Urine some Filings of Brass, thinly spread on a piece of Paper, there was a manifest Blewness pro∣duced in about a quarter of an hour. But I thought also of another Way, which I presumed would be better lik'd by most Traders, as more Com∣modious; because the Agent, being in a dry Form, cannot, like Spiritu∣ous Liquors, be spilt; and tho' it be more easily procur'd, may serve the turn almost as well. This Agent is common Sal Armoniack, of which, Page  194 when I have occasion to use it, I re∣duce a greater quantity to Powder, than I guess the quantity of Water, I shall need, will dissolve; that the Liquor may be satiated with the Salt. With this Brine I throughly wet Filings of Brass, (or Copper) after the forementioned manner, thinly spreading them with my Finger on a piece of Paper, or some other fit and flat Body; and in a short time (as about a quarter of an hour or less,) there will appear a Greenish blew Colour, drawn from the Brass by the Liquor: Which (Liquor,) I suppose, I need not tell you, will not work on the Gold, wherewith the Brass is mingled.
SECT. XI.
I Have observed such a Variety of appearances, and disguises, of Metalline Bodies, and some other Mi∣nerals, that I would advise those that Page  195 are given to the Search of Mines, and other Fossiles to have their Eyes always open, when they pass (es∣pecially by Land) from one place to another; that they may be ready to take notice of any unknown, or un∣common, Fossile, that they chance to see in their Way; and that having taken it up, they do not neglect to ponde it in their hands (which af∣ter a little Practice 'twill not be dif∣ficult to do, tho' not exactly, yet not unusefully) and, if they judge it to exceed the Weight of Chrystal, or Marble, to examine it Hydrostatical∣ly at their first Conveniency. For there are in England, as well as in divers other Countries, useful Fos∣siles, that are wont to be overlooked by the unskilful▪ and I have found in this Kingdom, even upon, or very near, the Highways, Eagle-stones; and some other Minerals, that were not suspected to be of English growth. And, I remember, that having occasi∣on in the Country, to pass by the Work-house of an ingenious Potter, Page  196 that I sometimes imploy'd in his Profession; and having view'd the ground somewhat attentively, among some other uncommon Fossiles that I took notice of, I made a discovery of Manganese, or Magnesia, whereof I gave the Potter an Advertisement, which he afterwards thankfully made use of, having found the Mine∣ral very proper for the glazing and and colouring of his Vessels.
Nor was this the only kindness, that skill in Mineralogy, as little as mine was, enabled me then to do him. For he having invited me to view, very privately, a place where∣in there was great store of a Fossile Substance, that Men knew not what to make of, because they had not seen, nor heard of, the like in Eng∣land: The knowledge I had of some Italian Mines, made me quickly guess, What it was that was taken for an unknown Metal. For 'tis true, that this Mineral was not divided into Lumps of such Shapes and Bignesses, as make glittering Fossiles pass for Page  197 Stones among the unskilful, such as are the Marchasites whereof they make Vitriol, and are found by the Sea-shore, in or near the Isle of Wight, and, (tho' not so plentiful∣lly) in other parts of England (where I have found them;) but ran a great way (and I had not Time or Li∣berty to try How far) under ground, like a Veine of Metalline Ore. But this notwithstanding, I judg'd the Mineral to be but a Marchasite, in a Form, unusual indeed in Eng∣land, but which is not without re∣semblers in some parts of Italy; which Conjecture I found true the same day, by some easie Tryals, that manifested it to abound much more in Vitriolate Salt, than any Marcha∣site that I had examined in the form of Stones. So that, tho' I had no opportunity to try, whether or no it contained any better Metal than Iron; yet I concluded, that, Caeteris paribus, it might be employed to to make store of Vitriol, in far less time, and with far less cost, than the Page  198Marchasites made use use of, in the Vitriol Works at Deptford, or else∣where in England.
I remember also, that a Mineral of an odd, tho' pretty, appearance, being sent me, whose Species was unknown to the Mine-men that dug it up, I guess'd that it was a Fossile, that I had not found in a good Prin∣ted Catalogue of our English Minerals, (namely) the Ore of Bismuth. And in this Conjecture some Tryals, purpose∣ly made of that Mineral, sufficiently confirmed me; and gave me cause to be sorry, that the Vein, that afforded it, was so very small, as the Diggers found it, of an Ore, that has Proper∣ties Curious enough; and is by some famous Chymists affirmed to have some that are, not only Rare, but Wonderful.
But the chief thing that invites me to recommend, in this place, to those that Travel, an heedful eye on the Ore-like, or ponderous Substances, that may occur to them, is, That One of the Applications of our ge∣neral Page  199 Remark, about the Specifick Gravity of Fossiles, may be extend∣ed to an Use, that has not, that I know of, been made by Mineralists, and and which yet I thought fit not to overlook: because I see no need, we should be confin'd to examine only those Fossiles, whereof we can ob∣tain Parcels, big enough to be weigh'd in Water in the entire Body. For besides other Minerals, that may be found profitable to the Physician, the Drugster, or the Mineralist; the Ores, or Wombs, of Metals themselves, may be divers times found disguis'd in the Form of Earth, or of Mud, easie to be dry'd: Which Fossiles, tho' (because they chance not be found in Lumps) unfit to be kept imme∣diately suspended by an Horse-hair; may be conveniently enough exa∣mined by the help of a Glass-Jar, whose Weights in Air, and Water, and their Difference, (which gives the Specifick Weight of the Vessel) have been taken once for all, which I usually call an Hydrostati∣cal Page  200 Bucket. For this Vessel, being almost filled with the propounded Fossile, and carefully counterpoized in the Air, and then thorowly wet∣ted with Water; and when 'tis so, warily let down into the Water, and kept suspended by an Horse-hair to a tender Ballance; when, these things, I say, are done, the Difference be∣tween the Weight of the Mineral and Vessel, when they are under Water, and their former Weight, being ob∣served; and the Specifick Weight already found of the Vessel it self in Water, being substracted from that Difference; there will remain the Weight of the Fossile only, (which we here suppose, to be heavier in Specie than Water, and not to be dissoluble in it) or the Mineral it self, in that Liquor; and consequently, the Proportion between that Body, and Water of the same Bulk, as is elsewhere sufficiently declared.
Page  201
SECT. XII.
TO manifest, that This Expedient may be of use in divers Cases, I shall only here observe, that a late Author, who hath published an Ac∣count of Swedland, declares, that one of the best sorts of Swedish Iron (which, you know, is much esteemed in its kind) is divers times found, in the Form of a red Mud, at the bot∣tom of Lakes, or far lesser Stagnant Waters: which I the more readily believe, because I have found some English Okers (that pass but for red Earth, or Stone of that Colour;) to be richer in Iron, than I found some famous Ores of that Metal to be. And another experienced Writer, who gives us an Account of the Gold and Silver Mines of America, among which he spent several Years, takes notice, that Gold it self is found, from time to time, disguised into a Page  202 reddish Earth, or is (tho' unsuspect∣edly) harbored in it.* An Italian Mineralist, of repute in the last Age, doth also take notice, that a reddish sort of Earth doth sometimes con∣tain a Portion of the richest Metals. I have observed some Europaean Diamonds, as many call a sort of clear and finely-Figured Chrystals, to grow in a red Earth; whence I have taken up pretty store of them. And an inquisitive Traveller, who has been in the Indies, presented me with a certain Earth, which he affirmed to be from the Diamond Mines, (I presume, in the Kingdom of Colchon∣da) which I found to be also red, and which I made some Tryals of, that belong not to this place.
SECT. XIII.
BUt the profitablest Use, that a Mineralists may make of our Hydrostatical Bucket, is, to imploy Page  203 it much in weighing Variety of co∣loured Sands, and Gravels; particular∣ly, some hereafter to bementioned.
And to let you see, by an easie Instance, how apt we are to over∣look Sands for want of trying them by Weight, I shall not tell you, that I have sometimes seen a sort of Sand that was slighted as common or worthless, which, being washed and viewed in a Microscope, tho' none of the best, looked like an Aggre∣grate of small Granats, and perhaps was so; but shall here content my self to instance in that black Sand, that is commonly used in London and elsewhere, only to dry up the Ink of Words that have been new∣ly written. For having observed when I had some quantity of this in my hand, that it was manifestly heavier than common Sand; I thought it worth the being examined by the Hydrostatical Bucket; by which Tryal, that which we imployed, ap∣peared to be to Water of the same Bulk, near about as 4 6/10 to 1. And Page  204 having, for Reasons that I cannot stay to mention, judged this Sand to be a Mineral of a Martial Nature, I was confirmed in my Conjecture, by mel∣ting it down with two or three parts of Antimony, and casting it into an Iron Cone. But I was more than con∣firmed in the same Conjecture, when, having try'd it with a vigorous Loadstone, I found it to be far richer in Metal, than any of the English Iron Ores I had made Tryal of, and (except perhaps One) than any of the Outlandish: For, having taken, at ad∣ventures, some Drams out of a much larger Quantity, and weigh'd it; I found, that at least Seven parts of Eight would easily be taken up by the Magnet. But such Observations as these, are not the things that chief∣ly move me to recommend the Exa∣men of Sands and Gravels to the Mi∣neralist; particularly, those sorts of them, that, being somewhat ponde∣rous, are Reddish or Yellow, especi∣ally if they retain those Colours, af∣ter they have been made red hot, and quenched in cold Water.
Page  205Therefore to proceed to the men∣tion of richer Sands, 'tis known, That, from the Coast of Guyny, Europaean Traders, of several Nations, do yearly bring Gold, to a great value, which is washt or pickt out of the Sand. And even in Europe there are Ri∣vers, whose Sand is inricht by Grains of Gold, for which the Tagus that runs by Lisbon, and Pactolus, were famous among the Ancients. I knew an industrious Chymist, who own∣ed to me, that he got Gold with Profit, from the Sand, which he found in some places of the Banks of the Rhine: and there is a litle River in Savoy proceeding from the Moun∣tains there, on whose Banks, after a Land Flood, I saw poor People bu∣sie themselves in seeking for Grains of Gold. Some Tryal, (also) that I caused purposely to be made, confir∣med me in a Conjecture, which pos∣sibly may hereafter prove Beneficial to many; namely, that the Sands of divers places, if they be Skilfully treated by a dextrous Chymist, may Page  206 afford much more Gold, than is pickt or washt, out of them in Form of Grains. For besides, that there may be many Atoms, or Corpuscles, of Gold that are so very minute, and stick so close to Grains of Sand, that they are neither taken notice of by the Eye, nor separable by washing, and pick∣ing; besides this, I say, there may, as I conceive, be many Particles of Gold incorporated with the Body of the Sand, which may be a Kind of Womb for matter of a Golden Na∣ture, that a skilful Artist, by the help of proper Additaments, may se∣parate with Profit especially, if, with Litharge or Minium, he first reduce the Sand to a Glass, and then take care to get the Volatile Gold, by giving it a pure Body fit to retain and fix it, such as is fine Silver: Out of which, I remember, we separated by Quar∣tation, (tho' without Profit, because of the Charges, and of the small Quantity we could work with at once,) from as much vitrified Sand, and two or three fluxing Ad∣ditaments Page  207 of small price, as were con∣tained in one Crucible, (that broke too, before Operation was near done,) sixteen Grains of pure Gold; that you may yet see, if you desire it.
SECT. XIV.
IT need not startle you, that, in reciting this Experiment, I made mention of Volatile Gold. For, tho', I know, that divers learned Men, and some able Chymists themselves, look upon it as a Fictitious thing; and that seems to bear a kind of Contra∣diction in its very Name; in regard of the perfect Fixity they presume to be an Essential property of Gold: yet I do not scruple to dissent from them, being warranted so to do by my own Experience. For, I have, more than once, made use of a Way, wherein, by the help of an Addita∣ment, inconsiderable as to Bulk, and less as to Weight; one may, with∣out Page  208 a naked Fire, and in a Glass re∣tort, sublime Gold, (not prepared by previous Calcination) sometimes in the Form of a yellow, or golden co∣loured, Salt; and sometimes, when the Operation succeeded better, in the Form of thin Chrystals prettily shapt, Glossy, and as red as Rubies. But this upon the by; it may perhaps be more useful to Searchers of rich Fos∣siles not found in Lumps, if I take this occasion to observe, that when they meet with Sands, Earths, Mi∣neral Fragments, &c. that conside∣rably exceed Chrystal in Specifick Gravity; and by the Place wherein they are found, or by other Tokens, give hopes of their containing Corpuscles of a golden Nature: When this, I say, happens, it will not be adviseable, hastily to reject such Bo∣dies; but rather carefully to try, Whe∣ther they do not deserve a better U∣sage. For, having sometimes had the opportunity to discover Corpuscles of Mars, as Chymists call Iron and Steel, in a far greater Variety of Page  209 Fossiles, and of Disguises, than even many noted Chymists would have imagined, or some of them could, up∣on heedful Tryal, discover; I was much confirmed in my Suspicion, That Corpuscles of a Golden Na∣ture may be concealed in divers Bodies, which are thought not to contain any Metal; and that in more of those Minerals, that are lookt upon as Ores of some other Metal, because of its being mani∣festly Predominant, there may be mingled pretty store of Particles of Gold or Silver; which (because of the greater Quantity of that other Metal, or Mineral, that doth, as it were cover or disguise them;) lye unperceived, & usually unsuspected, by Persons not very well acquain∣ted with such Matters; and yet may, by One that is very skilful, be separated even with Profit.
Page  210
SECT. XIII.
BUt the Grounds of the foremen∣tioned Suspicion being as yet but Conjectural, I shall decline the particular mention of them in this place; and shall rather Advise, with reference to Ores in General, that those that would apply the Hydro∣staticks to Them, do labour to pro∣cure Samples of the Ores of differ∣ing Mines, especially if they be found in the same Country; and do either by Tryal or strict Enqui∣ry inform themselves, what Propor∣tion of the Metal, that denominates them, they contain. For these Por∣tions of Ores and Minerals, being carefully weighed in Air and Water, and their Specifick Gravities, being thereby made known, they may serve for a kind of Standard, by Comparison whereto we may of∣tentimes Page  211 make not altogether un∣useful Estimates of the Metalline Portions contained in other Parcels of Ore, of that Species, whether afforded by the same Mine, or Vein of it, or by any other of the same Metal) Hydrostatically examined.
For Instance, our English Lead-Ores, that are worth taking no∣tice of, may be, for distinction sake, divided into Three Kinds or Orders, and in each of these, there may be allowed a Latitude for greater, or lesser, Degrees of Goodness. The First sort is of those Ores, that, in the ordinary Way of melting, hold some of them from 30 lb of Lead, in an hun∣dred Weight of Ore, to 40; and others to 45 lb of the same Metal, and these by several are slighted, as mean; and scarce, if at all, worth work∣ing; especially, those that hold un∣der 35 or 40. As for the Second sort, that reaches from 45. to 60 lb, in the hundred; the most usual Pro∣portion, I have found in many Try∣als Page  212 hath been about half the Weight of the Ore in clean and Malleable Lead. These Ores are thought in, differently good and worth work∣ing: But other Ores comprised in this Second sort, held about 55, and some near 60, and these were lookt upon, not only as Good, but pretty Rich. And for the Third Sort, it consists of those that yield from 60 to 80. in the hundred, and these Ores are justly reputed very Rich, (in lead) especially these that come any thing near 80; for, I confess, I never met with any that reacht so far, but was assured by an ingeni∣ous & skilful Gentleman, Master of his Majesties Royal Mint, that he had found some such upon Tryal. But for me, I think that I have not above twice or thrice met with any that yielded me above 75. These lookt exceedingly Promising, as if they were all Metal, and I observed, whether the thing were casual or not, some Lumps to be composed Page  213 of divers great Cubes like Dice, sticking very hard to one another.
The Considerations, that moved me to offer the Advice given at the beginning of this Section, invited me to make Researches of the Spe∣cifick Gravity, not only of divers English Ores, as of Lead, Tin, &c. Of which I had carefully made a Collection, (that was lost by a sud∣den Fire, broke out in the place where I kept them,) but of the Ores that were presented me from seve∣ral Countries, both in Europe and America; as Swedish Copper and Iron Ores, German Silver and Tin-Glass Ores; Hungarian Antimonial Ores; New English Lead, Iron, and Copper Ores, &c. The Effects of some few of which Researches, that chanced to come to hand, whilst I was seeking for some Hydrostatical Tryals of Drugs, I thought it not amiss to insert in a Table annext to the Medicina Hydrostatica; be∣cause perhaps they may be of some Page  214 use, in making a previous Conje∣cture, about a Mines being, or not being, likely to be wrought with Profit, all other things concurring, that should do so. Which last Clause I desire should be taken notice of; because there are divers other Cir∣cumstances, besides the Proportion of the Metalline part in the Fossile, that are fit to be considered, [as, the Plenty, or Scarcity, of the Mi∣neral; the Easiness or Difficulty of coming at it, because of its depth, or its being, or not being troubled with Waters, &c; its Nearness to Plenty of Fuel; and the Conve∣niency of Water to drive Mills; its Nearness to, or Remoteness from, the Sea, or some Navigable River, con∣venient for its Transportation, to omit other important Circumstan∣ces] before One begins to work a Mine; which as they happen to be Commodious, or Inconvenient, may render the Attempt Adviseable, or Imprudent.
Page  215But Sir, I perceive, (tho' late) that I have forgot, I was to write, not a Book of the Tryal of Ores, and other Minerals, but a mode∣rately, sized Letter, about an Hy∣drostatical Way of Exploring their Specifick Gravity. And therefore, to avoid increasing the already too great Prolixity of this Paper, by making an Apology for it, I shall lengthen it, only to beg you to Par∣don it, and to look upon the Wri∣ter, as

TO give the Curious the Satis∣faction of seeing at one view, and so of easily comparing toge∣ther, the Specifick Gravitys of a good Number and Variety of Bo∣dies; and to save them the labour of turning over many Leaves of the foregoing Tract, to find the particu∣lar Body, whose Ponderosity they desire to know; I have caused to be annexed a Table, containing in an Alphabetical Order (tho' not a scru∣pulously exact One;) the Names of the Drugs, and other Bodies, whose Gravities are delivered in the fore∣going Papers; without scrupling to add some others, that I chanced to light on, in turning over some of my old and forgotten Notes.
Page  217But I must to the following Ta∣ble premise this Advertisement, (warranted by several passages of the foregoing Papers here laid to∣gether) That 'tis not to be expected, Every one that shall try the Specifick Gravities of the Bodies here menti¦oned, shall find all of them to be precisely the same, that the Table exhibits: Since, (not to mention, that perhaps every Experimen∣ter will not imploy so much Care, and be assisted with so much Use, in making Hydrostatical Tryals, as Those this Table consists of were made with) the Difference, that may sometimes be found between his Tryals and mine, may very proba∣bly be imputed to that Variety of Texture and Compactness, that may be found in several Bodies of the same kind, or Denomination; nei∣ther Nature, nor Art, being wont to give all the Productions that bear the same Name, a Mathematical preciseness, either in Gravity or in other Qualities.

POSTSCRIPT.
WHen I began to send the Essay, called, Medicina Hydrostatica, to the Press, and drew up the foregoing Preface to it, I in∣tended it should in the same Book or Volume, be accompany'd by another Help or two, to ex∣plore, and Improve the Materia Medica. But when the Essay it self, and the annex'd Epistle about a previous Exploration of Ores had been Printed off; I could not but perceive, that the Bulk of those two Tracts so far exceeded what I expected, that if I subjoyned what I at first de∣signed to add to it, it would prove a mis-shapen Book, and inconvenient to be open'd, wherefore it seemed expedient to divide the whole in∣tended Work into two Volumes or Tomes, whereof what had already past the Press, should make the first, which that it might be the sooner ser∣viceable should forthwith come abroad by it self, and the Second should consist partly of the other Papers abovementioned, as relating to the Materia Medica, and partly, of a Supplement to the first Tome, containing divers Histori∣cal Paralipomena, that by mistake were omit∣ted, and are fit to be there supply'd out of a fuller Copy, then that which by an Oversight was made use of at the Press.
FINIS.
