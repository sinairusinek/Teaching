Advertisement OF THE PUBLISHER.
I Find by some discourse I lately had with the Author, that his design in drawing up his Memoirs, being to set down what had occurr'd to him of his own Observation and Experiments, he purposely forbore to consult the Authors that have professedly written upon Me∣dical Waters, he would by no means have it thought, that he undervalued those Learned Writers that he forb••e to cite, because he had them not at hand, as well as because his design did not re∣quire he should transcribe from them. And therefore he desires, that his Rea∣ders should not be kept, by any thing he has written, from consulting other Wri∣ters that have treated of Mineral Wa∣ters, Page  [unnumbered] especially the late Ingenious Exerci∣tations, of the Learned Doctor Lister De Fontibus Medicatis Angliae (after men∣tioned by our Author,) and the curious little Tract of the FrenchMineral Wa∣ters, that was brought our Author in English, after his Memoirs were come to him from the Press, publish'd by the Vir∣tuosi of the famous Royal Academy, of Sciences at Paris, especially where they curiosly examine the Saline and earthly. Residences of Waters, which our Author has not done to the remains of our Eng∣lish Acidulae, of which Liquors he had for the most part such incompetent quan∣tities as concurr'd with another reason to discourag'd him from publishing his Tryals on them. Yet I may safely say what he offers here to the Reader is far beyond any thing that has been publish'd in this kind; for the Virtuosi as well as the Water-drinkers may reap no small be∣nefit by the perusal of this learned Trea∣tise, as containing a great number both of useful Observations, and unusual Ex∣periments.

THe Author of the following Pa∣pers had thoughts of reviewing and inlarging them before he parted with them; and at least, of an annex∣ing Notes to several of those Titles of the historical Platform, that are yet left untouch'd. But, besides his want of health and leisure, he was, by the supervening of some urgent occasions, oblig'd abruptly enough to lay aside this work he was about, and apply himself to others, that con∣cern'd him more than the Scrutiny of Mineral Waters could. Wherefore con∣sidering, that he had already made Annotations, though but short ones, upon most of the considerablest Titles or Topicks of inquiry, enumerated in the Second and Principal Part of his Page  [unnumbered] Schemes above them, he was content to give the ensuing writing unfinished as it was, to the Solicitations of some Vertuosi, who rather than tar∣ry till he should have an opportuni∣ty, which he knows not how long he shall want, were desirous to take what they sound ready, with all its imper∣fections. Which pressingness of theirs he could not deny to be the more ex∣cusable, on this occasion, because the communicated writing is not pretended to be a full and methodical History of Mineral Waters, but only a bundle of Short Memoirs, contributed to∣wards the compiling of such a Work.
These, that they may be the more conveniently cited or referr'd to, I thought sit to divide into six Sections; where of the First is introductory, and and contains some General Considera∣tions about the Occasion, the Subject, and some other things relating to those Memoirs. The Second contains only a set of Titles for the First Part of the proposed Work, because urgent oc∣casions kept me from making, as I Page  [unnumbered] intended, some Marginal Notes, upon several of the particular Articles. The third exhibits a Scheme of Titles for the Second Part of the propos'd work, viz. The way of experimentally exploring portions of a Mineral Water sever'd from the Spring or Receptacle. And because the Second Part is that which I mainly design'd, I have referr'd to it two other Sections, one, which is the Fourth, containing a Collection of Ex∣periments and Observations relating to the usual way of examining Mineral Waters by Galls, as a Specimen given on the 13th Title of larger Annotations on the Titles of the Second Part; and the other consisting of less copious Anno∣tations, and sometimes much shorter Notes on divers other Articles of the same Second Part. To which Lastly is subjoyn'd the sixth Section, consisting only of a Set of Articles, referrable to the Medicinal use of Mineral Waters; together with a Conclusion address'd to the ingenious Dr. that set me upon this Task. In prosecuting of which I desire Page  [unnumbered] it may not be thought strange, that I have not cited Authors that have writ∣ten of Thermae or of Acidulae. For in the disadvantageous Circumstances wherein I wrote, I should have been kept from consulting them, if I had had them at hand. And I thought it enough for for me at that time, to impart to my Friends, what my own Experiments and Thoughts had furnish'd me with, how little or mean soever that was. Which Advertisement is therefore the more fit to be here given, that I may not divert any from studying those more elaborate Pieces, that have within no long time been publish'd by skilful Men, and especially by the very learned, Dr. Lister.

    • 34. That Copper that hath been melt∣ed into a body, may be so subtilised and disguised, as to have a multitude of its metalline parts made ascend with others in the form of a trans∣parent Liquor like common Water, and yet by putting to it another sub∣stance, as volatile and colourless as it self, it will presently discover the Copper it contain'd by turning as blew as Saphire. 55
    • 35. Experiments discovering the in∣existence of Arsenick in Water, and somewhat of the nature of that dan∣gerous Mineral. 56
    • 36. The deleterious nature of Arsenick consists not only, or mainly in a tran∣scendently Acid, nor in a lixiviate causticle quality, but in a corrosive∣ness sui generis. ib.

Short Memoirs FOR THE Natural and Experimental HISTORY OF Particular Mineral Waters, Address'd to his Learned Friend, Dr. S. L▪
SECT. I.
SO many years, Sir, have past, since I had occasion to con∣sider Mineral Waters, and op∣portunity to make Tryals on them with any Application of Mind; Page  2 that, tho' since that time some Vir∣tuosi have been pleas'd publickly to declare, that they found some di∣rections they received from me not unuseful to the Examen of such Wa∣ters; yet having sorgotten many of my past thoughts, and lost on mislaid most of my Memorials about matters of fact relating to those Li∣quors, I fear I shall not be able to sa∣tisfy either you, or my self, by what I now write about them. But how ever, since you will needs have me say something upon this Subject since it is a noble one, as that where in the health of thousands is con∣cern'd; since 'tis of late grown to be more priz'd and discours'd of, than ever; and since I have observed mens curiosity about it to have been con∣fin'd to very narrow Limits, most men contenting themselves with the discoveries they can make by the Infusion of Galls (or their Body,) and perhaps a slightly improv'd evapo∣ration: Since, I say, I have these in∣vitations to obey you, I am content Page  3 to offer you my Advices, such as they are, for the drawing up of such a natural History of a Mineral Wa∣ter propos'd as, being comprehen∣sive of many Inquiries and Wayes of Indagation that even Physicians have either not known or over∣look'd, may probably afford a more reaching notice, and inlarg'd know∣ledge of the Subject treated of. Upon which account I have, I confess, a desire and an aim, tho' no great hope, that this rude Essay may, by your Improvements and those of your Learned Friends, be made of some service to the Publick.
2. But here I must ingenuously own to you, that notwithstanding the many wayes I propose, of dis∣covering the natures or Qualities of Mineral Waters, yet I think the surest way of knowing them, is a long and sufficient Experience of their good and bad effects. For I strongly suspect, and it may be partly know, that there are, beneath the surface of the Earth, divers Mineral Substances, Page  4some fix'd, and some volatile, some in the form of hard Bodies, some of soft ones, some of Liquors, and some of Fumes, divers of which the gene∣rality, even of Learned men, are alto∣gether strangers to; besides those that, tho' some men may chance to have seen, have their natures so lit∣tle known, that they have not so much as names assign'd to them. So that when I consider, that of the Ingredi∣ents we are unacquainted with (to pass by all the rest that the Earth may conceal) the proportions where∣in they are mingled may be num∣berless, and the Qualities resulting from these Commixtures may be very differing from those of the se∣parate Ingredients, I am apt too look upon the difficulty, of Securelyde∣termining the Effects of Mineral Wa∣ters à priori, as little, if at all, less than insuperable to Humane Under∣standings.
3. But this difficulty is not such, as ought to make us think it useless, to have a good Project of the natu∣ral Page  5 History of a Mineral Water. For 'tis no small advantage, to know what particulars are fit for our In∣quiry, to be furnish'd with a Sett of heads, to which one may conveni∣ently refer whatever he tries, or ob∣serves, about the Subject propos'd. And (which is yet more considerable) to be furnish'd with variety of Me∣thods or ways, to make Tryals fit for investigating the Nature, or exa∣mining the Qualities, of the propos'd Water; since by the number and vari∣ety of purposely and fitly devis'd Ex∣periments, he that makes them may, as it were, view his subject on all sides, and be much assisted to conjec∣ture, what Saline, or other Minerals known to us, and what quantities of them, do impregnate the Water he examines, and consequently what effects they are like to produce in Hu∣mane Bodies.
4. Though there be three sorts of things, fit to be taken notice of by him that would give an Historical account of a Mineral Water, whether Page  6 cold or hot, yet contenting my self to treat but very cursorily of those that belong to the first, and to the third of the three sorts, I have made a more full and particular Enumeration of the Titles that peculiarly belong to the second sort of observables, namely those that mention the various Tryals, Chymical and Mechanical, that are to be made with the Water after 'tis taken out of the Spring. This I pur∣posely did, chiefly because 'twas only of this sort of particulars that you de∣sir'd my thoughts, and partly also because they are most wanted and de∣sir'd by Naturalists and Physicians, and are like to prove the most in∣structive to them; having also this to recommend them, that, to make the greatest part of them by far, it is not necessary that a man repair to the place where the Spring rises, but he may at leisure examine the Water at home, where he may be accommo∣dated with Furnaces, vessels, and o∣ther conveniences, to make his Tryals upon it.
Page  7 5. A much less discerning Reader, than you, may perceive that in sor∣ming the insuing Project of a Natural History, I aim'd much more to assist practical Physicians to find the ver∣tues and effects of Mineral Waters, than to insorm Speculative Natura∣lists of their causes and manner of being generated. But yet a heedful peruser may find, that I have so en∣deavour'd to gratify Physicians that I have not been altogether •anting [especially in the First Part, which is almost wholly Mineralogical,] to the curiosity of Philosophers, as it re∣lates to all sorts of Mineral Waters: Tho' you may easily enough discern, and readily confess it, that the follow∣ing Paper does much more regard those cold ones, that from the Acid Tast that is found in most of them are call'd Acidulae, than those other Wa∣ters, that from their heat are com∣monly styl'd Thermae, because the for∣mer sort of Mineral Waters is that, which I have had the opportunity to be the more conversant in, as well as Page  8 that, about which alone you have de∣sir'd my Observations.
6. I had once thoughts of illu∣strating the following Setts of Ti∣tles with a kind of Rationale, briefly declaring the reason of their order and their number (sor both these were considerately pitch'd upon, not lighted on by chance.) But I was obliged to omit it, when I sound (as I quickly did) that I had too little leisure and health, to imploy much of either upon a troublesom work of no grea∣ter importance. And therefore, know∣ing your Perspicacity to be more than sufficient to make you discern some reason for the order wherein I have marshall'd the Articles of the last Sett of Titles which fall under the Cog∣nizance of your own Profession, I have not been solicitous to assign that Reason. And I presume 'twill be no great harm, if my hast have made me also omit to perform at present the In∣tention I had to make here and there some Brief Marginal Notes upon some of the Articles of the first Part. And Page  9 I thought it sufficient (if not also ca∣pable of making some amends for the newly mentioned Omissions) to make them somewhat numerous, and some of them large Annotations upon the Titles or Articles of the II Part: This being indeed the chief that I design'd to insist on, and present you.
7. I expect it will be wonder'd at, that so many Inquiries should be propos'd, and so many things direct∣ed to be taken notice of, about a Sub∣ject that hath been thought so barren, that men are wont to think their cu∣riosity great enough, if they inquire what colours the Mineral Water will strike with Galls, or Oaken leaves; and do observe what kind and quantity of Salt will remain after the evapo∣ration of the Liquor: And I much fear, that some, even of your profes∣sion, will think I cut them out a great deal too much work, by so many troublesome Queries and Tryals. But I confess that nature or long ex∣perience having made me, tho'not a Sceptical, yet a suspicious and dif∣fident Page  10 Philosophiser, I think my self obliged, on difficult occasions, to ask more than ten Questions before I pre∣sume to answer one. Nor do I think that the slightness of anothers curio∣sity dispenses me from industriously exercising mine. I might on this occasion represent, that tho' the grea∣test Naturalists, and Physicians among the Ancients, did not only mention, but admire and discourse of the Load∣stone; yet our Gilbert thought fit to examine it further, and was thereby able to discover far more numerous Phaenomena, than all them put toge∣ther had taken notice of. And I might add other instances to the same pur∣pose; but to answer more closely, and directly, I say, that, to discover the nature of Mineral Waters, being a thing far more difficult than those, that have not try'd, do imagine, I think we ought to view the Subject in as many differing lights as we can expose it to, and take in as many helps to discovery as we can; since a great many particulars, that singly, or at Page  11 the first view, seem not very perti∣nent, if they be survey'd in conjun∣ction, and be skilfully apply'd, may much conduce to the desir'd end. And perhaps hereafter it will be found useful, if not necessary, to make large additions to the Topicks, whose number is now thought redun∣dant: For the more qualities and other particulars, we are acquaint∣ed with in any Subject, the bet∣ter grounded, and the more enlarg∣ed knowledge we have of it. As for the trouble it may cost, to make the proposed Enquiries and Tryals, it may be said, 1. That they are not all necessary (though useful) nor yet of equal moment, and therefore the omission of some, that are less important, may not disappoint the main Searches. 2. I have purposely made most of the Tryals as easy and short, as the matter and Scope will permit; and those, that will not under∣go some trouble in seeking an useful truth, do not deserve to find it, especi∣ally since, in the chase of noble disco∣veries, Page  12 as in hunting the nobler game, the toyl oftentimes makes a part of the pleasure. And I have made the less scruple, to be somewhat ample in the enquiries I propound, because di∣vers observations have perswaded me, that Physicians ought to consider ve∣ry well both the nature of the Waters they ordain, and to what persons, for what Diseases, and in what man∣ner, they prescribe the use of them: For tho' many look upon them as such innocent Medicines, as, if they do no good, can at least do no harm, yet the effects, that have too often insu'd the unskilful use of them, especially when it was long continued, allow me not to look upon the drinking of Mineral Waters as a slight thing, that may safely be plaid with, but as that whereby we have seen, as very much good, so a great deal of mischief, done, especially some time after the operation is thought to be quite over, and perhaps almost forgot∣ten.
8. I look upon the examen of the Page  13 Properties, and other Qualities, of Mi∣neral Waters, as a thing that is there∣fore of the greater importance, be∣cause I am apt to think, upon proba∣ble grounds that, by a diligent inqui∣ry, there may be discover'd in Eng∣land (and in divers other Countries too) a far greater number than is yet imagin'd of Mineral Waters, especial∣ly Ferruginous ones; which I there∣fore guess will be found very nume∣rous, because, by some uncommon wayes of Tryal that I have imploy'd, I have found that divers Minerals that either men knew not what to make of, or by reason of their passing under other names did not suspect to be Martial, did yet partake of, and per∣haps abound with, parts of a Martial Nature. And I shew in another Paper [about the Magnetism of the Earth] that kindly provident Nature, or rather its Divine Author has, under various disguises, furnish'd our Globe with a far greater plenty and variety of Iron Ores and Minerals, that partake of that Metal, the most useful by far Page  14 to mankind, than of any other Metal. And as Martial Minerals do thus a∣bound in the Earth, so they are more dispos'd, than one would suspect such hard Bodies could be, to impregnate even such Liquors as are not mani∣festly acid, and seem unlikely to be able to work upon Minerals far less hard than they. To make this proba∣ble, we took not Iron Ore, or Embryo∣nated Mars, but pure Steel it self, the same as Needles were made of; and up∣on the minute Filings of it, we put some Tincture of Galls made with common Water, and filtred through Cap-paper, that the present colour of the Liquor, and the change we expect∣ed to be made in it, might the better appear: And by this Tryal we found that, in less than an hour, the transparent infusion of Galls was so alter'd, as to be grown not only opa∣cous, but of a dark and almost inky co∣lour, which it retain'd even after Filtration; and this tho' the Vial, that contain'd it, was very slender. A not unlike effect was produc'd by small Page  15 Filings of steel, but somewhat slow: lier in the red Tincture of Brazil, and in that of Logwood, made with com∣mon Water.
9. I know not whether it may not be fit to be represented, on this occa∣sion, that, in Countries manifestly abounding with Metalline and other Minerals, it may perhaps be worth while, that mens Curiosity descend much lower than the superficies or Turf of the ground, and make search both after Subterraneal Springs, and Wells, and their operations upon Humane Bodies. For I have upon Inquiry been assur'd, by those that in several places have visited Mines, that they have met with in them, and sometimes at very great Depths, running, as well as Stagnant, Waters, of differing Tasts, and sometimes other Qualitie; and that the Diggers, venturing to make use of them to quench their Thirst, as they found some of them mischievous (as Corro∣sive, Petrific,) &c. so they met with others that were not only innocently. Page  16 Potable, but Medicinal. Of both these sorts we have Instances in our Tin-Mines of Cornwal in Devonshire. And of the latter sort I receiv'd from an ingenious Gentleman, that has the oversight of some Cornish Water∣works, this memorable Answer to an Inquiry I sent him. The strangest Account, saies he, of Mineral Waters that I have yet had, was of that in the bottom of a Tin-work call'd Karn∣key, wrought above 60 fathom [that is 360 foot deep;] the Mineral being a mixture of Tin and Iron, and the Water Red and Puddle, yet drunk was cool and not nauseous, and would pass by Urine, near as Red as it was drunk, as I have been inform'd by those that drunk of it whilst it [the Mine] was working, being now struck out, [that is, the vein of Ore being degenerated, or lost.] However I believe Experiments might yet be made with Water much of the same nature. Thus far he, from whom notwithstanding the remoteness of the place he lives in, I hope to get Page  17 some of this Liquor, to make Tryal of; which if I do, I design you an ac∣count of the Effects.
I could enlarge upon the Subjects of these two last (the 8th and the 9th) Numbers. But after so long an Introduction to short Memoirs, 'tis high time that I come at length to set down the Topicks themselves that I design to propose.
SECT. II.
TITLES
For the Natural History of a Mineral Water propos'd, consider'd as being yet in its Channel or Recep∣tacles: (Being the first or mineralo∣gical part of the designed work.)
HE that would draw up the History of a Mineral Water. [to have its qualities some examin'd and some investigated,] should, in my opinion, make three sorts of ob∣servations about it. For first he ought Page  18 to take notice of those particulars that relate to it whilst 'tis yet under ground, or in its native receptacles▪ Next he is to examine the properties and other qualities of it, when 'tis drawn up by men at the Springhead or other receptacle: Lastly he is to con∣sider the operations and effects of it upon Humane Bodies, whether sick or sound, according to the several ways and circumstances made use of in administring it.
To the first of these three sorts of observations may be referr'd such heads or titles as these.
1. In what climate and parallel, or in what degree of Latitude, the Mineral Water do's spring up, or stag∣nate?
2. Whether the Spring-head, or o∣ther receptacle, do chiefly regard the East, the West, the North, or the South?
3. Whether the Water be found in a Plain or Valley? And if not whether it arise in a Hillock, a Hill, or a Moun∣tain?
Page  19 4. And whether it be found at or near the top, the middle, or the bot∣tom, of the rising ground.

SECT. IV.
Experimental Remarks upon the (usu∣al) way of examining Mineral Wa∣ters, by the help of Galls: Deliver'd by way of Larger Annotations upon the XIII. Article of the II. Part.
SInce the change of colour that Mineral Waters produce in the Infusion or Tincture of Galls, is the most usual way that many Physici∣ans, and the almost only that some of them, endeavour to discover or examine Mineral Waters by; it may be worth while, in this place, to set down some remarks, that I have made about this way of probation; & the rather because it may, mutatis mutandis, be not unusefully apply'd to the exploring the Quality's of Mineral Waters by Colorations, tho' made with other Materials than Galls. First then it may be observ'd, that one need not make an Infusion Page  34 or Tncture of Galls in common Wa∣ter, to try if by their means a new colour will be produc'd. For I am wont to beat them to Powder, and keep them in a Glass (not too big) exactly stop'd, by which means I have them alwaies in readiness to mingle with the Mineral Water, and alter the colour of it, if Galls be able to do it, almost in atrice: where∣as to draw the Tincture of Galls with Simple Water, often takes up seve∣ral hours, and the tinging parts are much weakn'd by being diluted by the Menstruum. If you would have a Tincture, the Powder of Galls, ty'd up close in a Ragg, and with it hung in the Liquor, makes the Infusion less muddy. If you be in hast, and have none of the Powder at hand, you may scrape as much of a Gall-Apple, as you need into the Mineral Water.
2. I have observ'd those Parts of the Infusion of Galls (especially it made by heat) that produce the new Colour with Ferruginous Waters, Page  35 to be more apt to fly away than one would think, the Infusion becoming often unfit to alter the Colour of the Martial Waters, whilst yet it self appears sufficiently high colour'd. Upon which account, I choose to make a Tincture of Galls not long before I mind to use it; And if I im∣ploy dry Galls, to take Powder that is not stale.
3. 'Tis no safe way, and may be very erroneous, that is usually taken in mixing Galls or their Infusion with the Water to be explor'd so care∣lesly, as is wont to be done. For those that are curious to make good Ink, will easily believe, that much of the deepness of the Colour depends upon the Proportion of Galls to the other Ingredient; and accordingly that by putting a much greater, or a much lesser, quantity of Galls, into such a quantity of the Mineral Wa∣ter, the resulting Colour may be more or less intense. To obviate which inconvenience, I take this course when the occasion deserves it; I make Page  36 my Infusion of Galls with a certain weight of the Powder in a determi∣nate weight of Water. As for instance I put about five gr. of powder'd Galls, to sleep for so many hours in an Ounce of Water. But if I make use of the dry Powder, then I am wont to put three or four grains into an Ounce of the Liquor to be examin'd; which is a way far more certain than the Common, wherein the Ingredients are aestimated but by Guess. I have have mention'd various proportions of powder'd Galls to the same quan∣tity of Liquor, because I have ob∣serv'd that there is really a great ine∣quality among the Mineral VVaters in which it may be put; and I have found by Tryal, that in an Ounce of the German Spaw, a single grain of Powder would immediately produce a sufficiently deep purple colour.
'Tis an inconvenience, that not only Galls, but the other Drugs here∣after to be mention'd, impart a high Tincture of their own to the com∣mon VVater they are infus'd in; and Page  37 therefore it were to be wish'd, and is fit to be endeavour'd, that we had some Drugg, that without imparting a colour to the common VVater it impregnates, would afford an In∣fusion fit to strike a blackish or a purple colour with Martial VVaters.
Though it be useful, yet 'tis not necessary, to imploy Galls to produce a colour in the Mineral VVater pro∣pos'd. For besides that 'tis known that usually, (tho' not alwayes, as I have try'd,) the same thing may be done, but somewhat more faintly, with Oaken Leaves, we may success∣fully enough substitute, for the same purpose, some other astringent vege∣tables, as dry'd Red-Rose Leaves, the Peel, and, (as we have try'd) the Juice of Pomegranates; and (what I find to be a notable stiptick) the blossoms of the same plant, (which are vulgarly call'd in the Shops Ballaustium.) To which may be added Myrobolans, Logwood, and some others that need not now be mention'd, whose strong Infusions Page  38 have yielded me a Tincture very dark and blackish with some Martial Li∣quors.
6. In regard that the Galls, or o∣ther Drugs, to be infus'd in common VVater, are not alwayes of the same goodness or strength, 'tis adviseable not so to trust to any determinate proportion of the Pigment to the VVater, as not to take in the help of the Eye, to judge by the Colour of the Tincture, whether the Liquor be duely (and not too much or too little) impregnated.
8. Whereas there is an intimation in the Close of this thirteenth Article of the present Sett of Titles, that Animal Liquors may be imploy'd to produce new colours with Mineral VVaters, I gave that hint, not only because 'tis usually observ'd in Martial VVaters, such as those of Tunbridge the Spaw, &c. that the gross excrements of the lower belly are blacken'd by a commixture of their Metalline Parts; but in Tun∣bridge VVaters particularly I have observ'd, that after the drinking of Page  39 larger doses of them, the root of the tongue, and perhaps some neigh∣bouring parts, would also acquire a dark colour, by the operation of the transient Liquor.
Though the way of trying Mine∣ral VVaters, by the change of colours that Galls produce in them, be use∣ful and recommended by being easy, cheap, and expeditious, yet I do not take it to be either of that extent, or of that certainty, that 'tis vulgarly presum'd to be of: For its main, if not only considerable, use is, to discover by striking, or not affording, a black or blackish, or at least a purple or a purplish, colour with a Mineral Wa∣ter, to manifest the Liquor to be, or not to be, either of a vitriolate, or a ferruginous nature. But there are di∣vers Metalline Ores, and other Mine∣ral Bodies, which not participating of Iron, will not by this way be disco∣verable and yet may strongly im∣pregnate the VVater propos'd: As for example, to try whether if Arsenic were mingl'd with VVater, Galls Page  40 would discover it by producing with it a dark colour, I put some of the Powder of them into a Decoction of arsenic, but did not perceive that it gave the Liquor any deeper colour, than it would have done to common VVater. And as the extent of this explorer of VVaters is not very great, so neither do I find the informations it gives us to be so certain, as they are presum'd. For, if I much misre∣member not, I long since found upon tryal purposely made that another Body of a Metalline nature, and that did not partake of Iron, would with infusion of Galls afford a very dark colour, that might easily, among or∣dinary Beholders, pass for the co∣lour produc'd by a Martial VVater; and I do somewhat doubt, whether so much as all Liquors impregnated with Iron, will de discover'd to be so, by the colour they afford with Galls; for I have sometimes made such a Liquor with no Mineral Substance in it, save steel or Iron but I did not find it would turn the Infusion of Galls either Page  41 blackish or purple, which made me suspect, that these colours are afford∣ed only by such Martial VVaters, as have been wrought upon more or less by some Acid Salts or Fumes.
9. Unto these things I shall add, that I found that to be a mistake, which is generally taken for grant∣ed, viz. That the infusion of Galls will certainly discover, by becom∣ing black, (or purple,) if a Mineral Water, that is mix'd with it, be vitri∣olate; for, tho' it be true that if, in the vitriolated VVater, Iron be the only or predominant Mineral, or be at least considerably participated by the Liquor, yet if the dissolv'd vit riol be altogether copperish, I found by seve∣ral Tryals purposely made with a strong solution of Roman vitriol, (wherein Copper is affirm'd to be the only, or to be very much the predominant, Metal,) that it would not with insusion or Tincture of Galls, afford either a black or a black∣ish colour, but only a thick and muddy one, that was not so much purplish.
Page  42 It comes into my mind upon this occasion that from one of the Nor∣thern Countreys of England, where there are divers Mineral VVaters, there was brought me by a Virtuoso, a good quantity of very whitish Earth, which he suspected to be of a pecu∣liar nature, but could not tell of what. This odd earth being examin'd, I con∣cluded it to contain a considerable proportion of Lead Ore, corroded by some Mineral Salts, and imbody'd with the Soyl; so that if it had been in a place where people had sought for Mineral VVaters, 'tis probable that, finding some peculiarity in the tast of those that pass'd through this Earth, they would have taken it for a Mineral Water, but had been at a great loss to determine what Mine∣ralit did partake of; and perhaps, in en∣deavouring to resolve the doubt by drinking it, they would have found very bad effects of it. But probably the Sulphureous Spirit to be ere long describ'd in this Paper would have inform'd them, that the Water was Page  43 impregnated with a Body of the na∣ture of vitriol, but not of com∣mon vitriol. For tho' Galls do not give a black, or very blackish, colour with a solution of Saecharum Saturni,(which is indeed the vitriol of Lead) resolv'd in distill'd or rain Water. Yet I found by Tryal, that this volatile Sulphur did manifestly and presently do it; which Tryal I was fain to take up with, because when I had occasion to consider this matter I had not at hand the ores of Lead, Copper, &c. And therefore was fain to content my self with the solutions of the Metals themselves in their proper Menstruums; it being probable, that the Metalline parts of the Ores would have afford∣ed either the same solutions, or some very like them, in the same Menstru∣ums; which consisting of Niter, Sea-Salt, & Vitriol, Bodies that abound in diverse places of the Earth through which Springs flow, the impregnated Water would afford Phaenomena of the same kind. I made tryals also upon a somewhat fine solution of refin'd Page  44 Gold made in an Aqua Regalis, and upon a solution of common running Mercury, made with Aqua fortis, and in a clear solution of Tin, made, not with either of the foregoing Men∣struums (for I have not found them to dissolve it genuinely) but in a peculiar Solvent, (which I have communicat∣ed in another Paper,) that does not only dissolve it readily, but keep it permanently dissolv'd, as Aqua fortis do's Silver, but not Tin. To these so∣lutions I put Galls, without obtaining any blackish colour except from that which contain'd Gold. But with our Sulphureous Liquor we produc'd no∣table changes of colour, and those in all the solutions but one a dark one or tending to blackness, and tho' for that reason a careless eye might judge them indiscriminately to be blackish; yet since I well remember that the degrees, or some other modification, of the same dark colour seem'd plain∣ly enough not to be the same in all of them, I do not think it impossible but that a very heedful Beholder Page  45 (which when I made those Tryals I had no great motive to be) may dis∣cern between those obscure colours some little differences, that may much assist him to guess, what metalline substance is contain'd in the Liquor, or at least is predominant in it, if it be a compounded one. And I particu∣larly remember, that the colour that sprang from our Sulphureous Liquor and solution of Tin, was manifestly distinguishable from those produc'd in that of any of the other solutions, be∣ing not black or blackish, nor so much as purple, but of a kind of brownish yellow.
Though I am content that the things, I come from mentioning, should make men cautious and diffi∣dent, yet not only I do not despise or slight the use of Galls, &c. even as it it is vulgarly practis'd, but I am apt to think that the way of exploring Mineral Waters by the changes of colour, that may be produc'd in them or by them, when they are mingled with convenient Drugs or Addita∣ments, Page  46 may be made of greater extent and use than he, that has read what I have written in the foregoing num∣ber, will perhaps be forward to ex∣pect. But to make the way of ex∣ploring Mineral Waters by colorati∣ons, of somewhat more general use and less uncertainty, I would re∣commend these things to the experi∣menter,
(1.) It seems very fit, if not ne∣cessary, that he look upon the change of colours, both while 'tis producing, and when 'tis produce in a good light and with a heedful Eye. For by this means he may discover several shades or varietys of the more princi∣pal colours, and some other circumstan∣ces that he could not else take notice of; and which yet may afford good hints (in reference to other Minerals, as well as Martial ones,) to a sagaci∣ous observer. And I have sometimes fancy'd, that there may be a kind of Physio gnomy of many, if not most, other natural Bodies as well as of hu∣mane faces, whereby an attentive Page  47 and experienc'd considerer may him∣self discern in them many instru∣ctive things, that he cannot so declare to another man, as to make him dis∣cern them too.
(2.) The Attention here encou∣rag'd may perhaps be made more instructive, by a way that I have sometimes practis'd to vary the Shades, and other Phaenomena of Colours produc'd with Mineral Li∣quors. This way consists chieflly in preparing Sheets of White Paper by drenching them in a strong Infu∣sion of Brasil, Log-wood, or some o∣ther convenient dying stuff, and then letting them dry leasurely in the Air, which may give some of them, as I have observ'd, a colour differing enough from that of the Liquor look'd upon in a Vial or drinking Glass. Upon this dry'd Paper ye may let fall, but not all on the same place, some drops of the Mineral Liquor to be examin'd, especially if it be of a Sa∣line nature, and by the Changes of Colour, effected by these Drops on the Page  48 Parts of the Paper, they fell and spread themselves upon, a heedful ob∣server may be assisted to guess, what kind of Mineral impregnates the Li∣quor, and how much it does so; e∣specially if on the same Sheet of Pa∣per some other fit Mineral Water or idoneous Liquor be likewise dropt, that the changes of colour produc'd by the two Fluids, may be sur∣vey'd and compar'd together. I also practis'd another way some∣what differing from this; as the main part of which we prepar'd white Pa∣per, by rubbing well upon it, with a hares foot or some such thing, some idoneous Powders, especially that of vitriol (whereof for this purpose Eng∣lish seem'd the best) lightly calcin'd in a gentle heat till it became of a grayish colour and friable between the Fingers. By this means 'twas easy to make the Paper fit for our turn. For the finer parts having lodg'd themselves in its Pores, with∣out much discolouring it when the supersluous dust was struck off, it Page  49 became capable of affording a varie∣ty of Colours, or rather shades, some deeper and some fainter, when I let fall on it some drops of differing Mar∣tial Liquors. But of the Examenof the Materia medica, by the changes of colour produc'd in it or by it, more is said in another Paper; and therefore, instead of transferring that hither, I shall here briefly intimate, that divers variations of colour may be made, either by infusing or other∣wise mixing, as I have sometimes done something in the Mineral Water before the tinging stuff be put to it: or by put∣ting somewhat in the Infusion or Pow∣der of Galls, before it be mix'd with the Mineral Water, or else by dropping fit Liquors (such as Spirit of Salt sirst; and then Spirit of Urine, or Oyl of Tartar) into the Blackish or Purple Mixture of Galls and the Medicinal Water to be examin'd. For by these means diverse variations of colours may be observ'd; which, together with some other wayes that I have Page  50 made use of to multiply them, I have not now leisure to set down.
(3.) It is not convenient to con∣fine ones self to the use either of Galls or Oaken Leaves, but to make use also of Red Roses, Balaustium, Log-wood, Brasil, and other astringent vegetable Pigments. For, though some of these give a deeper Tincture than Galls yet, by the diversity of co∣lours produc'd by them in Mineral Waters, an attentive Beholder may, as was lately intimated where I mention'd diversity of Lights and Shades, discover some things that he would not be informed of, or receive any hints of, by the help of Galls of Oaken Leaves alone. Nay I would not have our experimenter imploy none but vegetable substances about his co∣lorations, but sometimes make use of Animal ones, and (more often) of Minerals: Since by this means he may much diversify his Tryals, and in∣crease the number of Phaenomena, some of which he may probably find instructive. Besides astringent Plants Page  51 I have found, and sometimes de∣vis'd, other substances that will turn black as well as Galls, with vitriolated Water; and that not only with those that are richly impreg∣nated with Iron, but also with those wherein Copper alone abounds, as in Roman vitriol. And tho', for certain reasons, I must not now set down a way I have, to discover in a trice both these vitriols, without any Liquor or Tangible Body, yet I shall sub∣join, as a kind of Succedaneum that may suffice for the present occa∣sion, the way of making a Liquor that will presently turn black with a solution either of Martial or Cupre∣ous vitriol.
Take equal parts of pure Salt of Tartar, and either Flowers of Sulphur, or at least Sulphur finely powder'd, and good Sal-armo∣niac, reduce the first and the last to powder separately, melt the Sulphur over a gentle fire, and by degrees put to it the Salt of Tar∣tar, stirring them well, to makePage  52them incorporate and grow red (or reddish.) Then put this mixture pulveriz'd into a Glass Retort, or a cucurbite, and pour on it the Sal-Armoniac dissolv'd in fair Water, and closing well the Junctures, distill all in sand by degrees of a moderate fire, shifting the receiver once or twice, because the Li∣quors will be differingly ting'd and strong; and that which ascends last, may bring over but very little of the Sulphur, whose volatile Tin∣cture is yet the main thing we aim at in this operation.
(4.) I do not despair but that he, who were able to make a skilful use of the several Drugs and other Bo∣dy's, Vegetable, Animal and Mineral, that may produce new colours in or with Mineral Waters, (or in some cases with the substances that impregnate them,) may by their means be also inabled to discover the presence or inexistence of divers other Minerals, some of them salu∣brious, or at least safe, and some o∣thers Page  53 either hurtfull, or at least dan∣gerous, that are not taken notice of by those that content themselves to imploy Galls and Oaken Leaves, in the exploration of the Waters they examine. For some of these Liquors contain Salts, that having not cor∣roded either Martial or Cupreous Ores or Marcasites, do not betray themselves by producing either an Inky or a fainter degree of Blackness, or else a Purple, with the Drugs made use of to change their Colours. Ofthese Salts I have met with more than one sort, which may be more properly take notice of, when we consider the Mineral Water and its contents.
12. I think it likewise very possible, that industrious men should find wayes to discover, by the help of the change of colours, whether Orpiment or native Arsenick, or the like poi∣sonous Minerals, do so impregnate the Water propos'd, as to make it very hurtful or dangerous, thô not ab∣solutely pernicious. And as for Sul∣phur, Page  54 there may be several Waters that partake of it, without being taken notice of to do so. For I remem∣ber, that I have sometimes purposely made a Liquor, that was limpid and colourless like Spring Water, and which would totally fly up, even with a gentle heat; and yet this Li∣quor was richly impregnated with a Mineral Sulphur, as I convinc'd se∣veral virtuosi by manifest and ocular proofs. So that if Sulphur chanc'd to be combin'd with any Salt or Mi∣neral, of those many subterraneal ones that nature hath hid from us, that can suppress or disguise its pecu∣liar odour, the Water may be conside∣rably, and yet unobservedly, impreg∣nated with it. And yet 'tis like this may easily be discover'd by the change of colour, producible in such a Sul∣phureous Liquor by vitriolate Bodies, and, other appropriate additaments: Which may be thought the more pro∣bable, because, thô the Spirit lately describ'd be very transparent and to∣tally volatile in the form of a Liquor Page  55 sometimes pale enough, yet common English Vitriol, as also that of Danzick which is Venereal, will presently turn it of a black or very dark colour. And to add here something more dif∣ficult to be perform'd, I have devis'd a way, which * I elsewhere deliver, whereby it may appear that even Copper, that hath been melted into a Body, may be so subti∣liz'd and disguis'd, as to have a multitude of its metalline Parts made to ascend, with others, in the form of a Transparent Liquor like common Water: And yet by putting to it a lit∣tle of another substance, as volatile and colourless as it self, it would pre∣sently disclose the Copper it contain'd by turning blew as a Saphire.
13. Because Arsenic is a very per∣nicious Drug, and yet has been sus∣pected to be clandestinely mingled with some Mineral Waters, which I thought the less improbable, because Page  56 some of the Marcasitical Bodies by which some Mineral Waters pass, are judg'd not to be devoid of Arsenic, for these reasons, I say, and for this other which makes the mention of it pertinent in this place, that Galls did not (as I elsewhere note,) dis∣cover at all the inexistence of this poysonous Drug in Water, thô the Liquor were copiously impregnated with it, I thought fit to make some Trials, that seem'd to me likely to discover at once the in existence of Arsenic in Water, and somewhat of the nature of that dangerous Mi∣neral.
Happening some years ago to tast Arsenic, not without some little dan∣ger and inconvenience, the Tast of it did not seem to me to favour the vulgar supposition, that its poyso∣nous nature consists in a highly Acid Salt; whereas its Tast agrees well with my Conjecture, who suspect it to be of an exceeding corroding or fretting nature, but whose corro∣siveness is sui generis, that is, of a pe∣culiar Page  57 kind. Having then made a strong solution of Arsenic in common Water, [which does not without some skill easily dissolve it,] we mix'd a small proportion of it with the German-Spaw Water, and then dropping into this mixture some high∣ly dephlegm'd Spirit of Urine, we perceiv'd a light Lactescence to be produc'd, and a whitish Precipitate very slowly to subside.
We found also that a little (ex∣cellent) Oyl of Tartar per deliquium, being drop'd into some of the lately mention'd solution of Arsenic, pro∣duc'd a heavy whitish cloud, which presently settled at the lower part of the Glass. We also put Oyl of vitriol, as one of the strongest Acids we know, into the solution of Arsenic, but did not perceive, that the Oyl made a Precipitation, or wrought much otherwise on it than it would have done upon common Water. And by these three Tryals one would suspect, that Arsenic is, at least ex prae∣dominio, an Acid Body.
Page  58 But not content with these, we put some of the Arsenical Liquor upon some Syrup of Violets, and found it to change the Syrup, thô but slowly, rather to a Green than a Red or Purple Colour.
We put, to another portion of the same Liquor, some of our volatile sulphureous Spirit, but took no∣tice of no Precipitation that en∣sued.
For a severer Examen we imploy'd a Tryal that we successfully make use of (and have deliver'd in another Paper) to discover such slight de∣grees of Acidity in Liquors, as by ordinary Tryals are not discoverable; but we could not by this way dis∣cern the least Acidity in our Arseni∣cal Solution, but rather a manifest token of an Urinous or Lixiviate Quality.
With the former Experiment a∣greed very well that which we afte¦wards made, by putting some of the Arsenical Liquor into a strong solu∣tion of common Sublimate made in Page  59 fair Water. For by this means we had a copious Precipitate, such as might have been expected from an Alkaline Precipitant. And this was not brick-colour'd, as fix'd Alcali's produce with dissolv'd Sublimate, but white, such as Urinous or Volatile Al∣calies, (as they call them,) are wont to make with the same Liquor.
The forgoing Tryals having been made at one time, when I was in hast, and not at all fond of having to do with Arsenic (for which reason I caus'd the solution to be presently thrown away to prevent dangerous mistakes;) thô what I have hitherto try'd seems very favourable to our propos'd conjecture;
That thô Ar∣senic be a very corrosive Body, and perhaps upon that score poyso∣nous, yet its deleterious nature does not consist only or mainly in a tran∣scendently Acid, nor in a lixiviate caustick Quality, but in a corrosive∣ness sui generis, I mean peculiar and distinct:
Yet I shall forbear to be positive in this conjecture till fur∣therPage  60Tryal, pretending only, by what has been said, to shew the need of exa∣mining the vulgar supposition by fur∣ther Inquiries, and to give some hints towards the finding of Antidotes against this cruel Poyson.
I shall now add that, for the sake of Water-drinkers, I cast about in my Thoughts for some way that might be of some use, thô of no certainty, in examining a Mineral Water suspected to contain Arsenic. To which pur∣pose, for Reasons which hast forbids me to mention, I pitch'd upon vitrio∣late Bodies and found that if a little solution of DantzickVitriol were put to a convenient quantity of Arseni∣cal Liquor, there would presently in∣sue a great change of colour, and a dark Substance would by degrees pre∣cipitate it self and settle in the lower part of the Glass. The like effect we found, when we put English vitriol, which (having no Copper added in the making, as that of Dantzick has,) is either altogether or almost to∣tally Martial, into a considerable Page  61 proportion of the Arsenical Solution.
I fear I shall be thought to have dwelt by far too long upon this one (13) Article of our Sett of Titles: But I was tempted to do it, Part∣ly, because I thought the Subject seem'd both to merit and to need it, Partly, because I thought fit to give an Instance that may shew that even that part of the Exploration of Mineral Waters, that is judg'd to be the most cultivated, hath been but superficially enough consider'd. And Partly, too, because my want of health, and my preingagement to some Subjects that I am more con∣cern'd for then I am for that I now treat of, permitting me to make few other than shorter Notes upon the par∣ticular Articles and clauses of this Scheme of Titles; I thought it not amiss, by referring all the foregoing Observations and Tryals to the same Topick, to give one Specimen (thô but an imperfect one) of those that, for distinctions sake, I style Large Annotations. And though Page  62 the Title, these belong to, be the Thirteenth in the Scheme (of the II Part,) yet I thought fit to premise these Notes to all the rest? though divers of them be on Titles antecedent to the Thir∣teenth, because one or other, of the many Particulars refer'd to this last nam'd Title, may pro∣bably be of use to you in con∣sidering many of the other Ar∣ticles of this Scheme, whether they follow the Thirteenth, or pre∣cede it.

Marginal Notes For the II. Or Physico-Chymical Part of the Natural History of a Mineral Water propos'd.
Notes on the first Title.
I. 1. THe Article mentions Ac∣tual coldness and Heat, because we do not here consider that which the Schools call Poten∣tial.
2. The knowledge of the degree of Coldness in the Water, especially if it be extraordinary, may somewhat assist the Examiner to guess, whether the Spring come from some notable depth under ground before it ascends, or whether it runs through a soyl abounding with Salt-Peter or Sal-ar∣moniac, Page  64 or some such very refrigerat∣ing substance.
3. The degree of Coldness or Heat may be estimated several wayes as, if the Water be cold, by its having, or not having, the power to coagulate Essential Oyl of Anis seeds, or that of Fennell seed; & if it be that, by its be∣ing, or not being, able to melt Bodies of somewhat differing dispositions to Fu∣sion, as Butte, Tallow, Bees-was, &c. Or to coagulate the whites of Eggs, or to boyl Eggs in the Shell, &c. But the best way is to plunge into the Wa∣ter propos'd, or least the whole Ball or globulous part of a good hermetical∣ly seal'd Thermoscope, whereon the degrees of cold and heat are carefully mark'd.
Notes on the Second Title.
II. The knowledge of the specifick Gravity of a Mineral Water, may be of great use to him that endeavonrs to discover its nature, not only as this knowledge inables him to distinguish Page  65 the propos'd Water from others, but because it may afford him a conside∣rable and double information. For, by comparing the weight of the pro∣pos'd Liquor with that of common Water, he may be, in case the former be heavier (as it usually happens to be) assisted to estimate what pro∣portion of Salt, or Martial, or other Mineral Substance, it is impregnated with. And if it be very light, and much more if it be lighter than com∣mon Water, he may probably con∣clude that the Substance, that im∣pregnates it, is either very small in quantity or proportion, or is not near so gross as is to be found in other Mineral Waters, but of a Spirituous and Volatile nature which is a disco∣very of no small moment in this af∣fair. And thó that may seem a para∣dox which I here suppose, that a Wa∣ter impregnated with a Metalline or Mineral Substance should be as light or even lighter than common Water. Yetupon Tryal carefully made I have found some Mineral Wa∣ters, Page  66 as particularly that of Tun∣bridge well taken up, and (thô they be somewhat less light) that of the German Spaw, and of some of the Is∣lington Springs, to be manifestly ligh∣ter than common Water, and some taken up at Tun bridge I found to be lighter than common Water, even pu∣rified by Distillation.
And thô it be very hard to con∣ceive, yet I think it not impossible, that a Subterreneal Substance, that im∣pregnates Water, should be lighter in Specie than it: but yet I would not re∣fer this surprizing Levity, in all ca∣ses, nor all of it in most cases, to the admixture of lighter Corpuscles, be∣cause some Tryals justify'd the suspi∣cion I had, that much of the Compa∣rative Lightness proceeded from this, That the Mineral Water was imbued with a smaller quantity of vulgar or culinary Salt, than common Water uses to contain. But yet these Tryals did not satisfy me, that this paucity of common Salt was the sole or ade∣quate cause of the lightness of the men∣tioned Waters.
Page  67 But, to discover such minute diffe∣rences, one must have good Instru∣ments, and indeed, to speak freely, there are few, upon whose Re∣ports I durst confidently relye, for the Specific Gravity of Mineral Wa∣ters. For to weigh Liquors any thing exactly there is requisite more Heed∣fulness, and more Skill, and better In∣struments, than are easy to be met with together, and than we usually imagine. And, when Physicians and others weigh Mineral Waters, they are wont to do it in some Apothecary or other Trades▪mans Shop, where, if the Ballances be small, the Vessels and the Water are commonly too heavy for them, and oftentimes wrong them. And if, as is usual, the Bottles or other vessels be great, they require far better Ballances than are usually imploy'd in the Shops of Apotheca∣ries or Grocers, whose Ballances a Critical Examiner will too often find to be far from being accurate, inso∣much that usually, without at all al∣tering the weights, thô perhaps not Page  68 great ones, he may easily make which Scale he pleases manifestly prepon∣derate, and continue in that position, and may as easily afterwards give the other Scale the same advantage: The diligent and experienced Mathe∣matician Mersennus much com∣plains of the difficulty he found to weigh Liquors exactly, even by the help of his Nicer Instruments. The accuratest way, I know, is by com∣paring the differing weights that the same sinking Body has in common Water, and in the Liquor propos'd. But this way (which I elsewhere circumstantially deliver) requiring, besides good Instruments, skill in Hydrostaticks, is practicable but by few. And the way of comparing Wa∣ters, by the greater or lesser sinking of the same Cylinder or other swim∣ing Body into them, is scarce accu∣rate enough. Wherefore I chose to make a very skilfull Artist blow, at the flame of a great Lamp, a thin round vial with a flattish bottom, that it might stand upright, and be Page  69 very light, and this was furnish'd with a neck as large as a Goose quil drawn very even into a hollow Cylinder of above 3 Inches long, and fitted at the top with a little Gap, that hinder'd the Water from ascending above the due height.
This Glass contain'd ℥iiiss and 43 grains of common Water, and yet when empty, weigh'd but ʒvi+ 42 grains: So that I could use it, when full of Liquor, in such a Ballance, that the addition or detraction of half a Grain, or less, would make either Scale preponderate. The length and evenness of the stem was design'd for uses not needful to be mention'd here; where it may suffice for my purpose to say, that this Glass was judged capable of holding Water enough for not uncurious Tryals, and yet not to be, thô well fill'd, too heavy for a tender Ballance. In this Vessel herefore we carefully weighed several Liquors (whose Gravity be∣longs not to this place) and among them diverse Mineral Waters, some Page  70 of which, at least known here at Lon∣don, were found to be of the annex∣ed weights.
The Glass being fill'd with several Liquors to the same height, and weighed in the same Ballances.

By this short account it may ap∣pear, that, as divers Mineral Waters (that contain Salts in them) are con∣siderably heavier than Common Wa∣ter, Page  71 so some, especially Ferruginous Waters, are impregnated with so fine a substance, as to be lighter than com∣mon Water.
Notes on the Fourth Title.
IV. This Article may, in divers ca∣ses, give some light to the discovery of the kind of Soyl, through which the Water has pass'd; and is also useful to distinguish the Spontaneous resi∣dence, if I may so call it, that the Li∣quor lets fall by meer standing, from that which they call the Caput Mor∣tuum, that remains after the total eva∣poration of the Water; by which means also the weight of this last re∣sidence may be more truly known. Besides some other Mineral Waters, I found that the German Spaw Waters, brought very well stop't to London, afforded by long standing a pretty quantity of Terrestrial substance, that look'd almost like yellow Oke•, and perhaps was of great affinity to it in nature. 3. That clause in the Article, Page  72thô the Liquor be kept from the Air, was therefore set down, because I had found by Tryals, that some Liquors, by being expos'd to the free Air, would have copious, and sometimes surprizing, substances separated from them; as if the Air contain'd some Precipitating Salts, fit to work on the Liquors, so as to make in them such notable separations.
Notes on the Fifth Title.
V. An accidental weakness I had, in my eyes, when I had the best oppor∣tunity to endeavour satisfying my self about this Inquiry, forc'd me to leave the prosecution of it to others. Only two things I shall take notice of on this occasion: One is that, having caus'd one that had young Eyes, and was accustom'd to make use of such Microscopes as are mention'd in the Article, to look upon some Mineral Waters through them, he said he could discern no difference between them and common Water. Notwithstand∣ing Page  73 which the Tryal ought to be re∣peated by various persons, on several Waters, with differing Engyscopes, and in differing Lights, and other circumstances. The other is, that whereas it is by divers learned men objected, against the goodness of these magnifying Glasses we now make use of to look on Liquors, that the little Bodies that the ingenious, Mr. Lewenhoeck, and since him di∣vers other Virtuosi, have observ'd in Water wherein Pepper has been in∣fus'd, are not, as he pretends, living creatures, but little inanimate con∣cretions, that are casually form'd, and carry'd to and fro in the Liquor: To convince these Doubters, of whose number I was my self at first inclin'd to be, I devis'd the following expe∣riment: Having laid, upon the magni∣fying Glass, a part of a drop of Wa∣ter, wherein I could see store of these little Animals frisking up and down, we put to the Liquor, with a bristle or some such very slender thing, part of a drop of Spirit of Salt, which, as Page  74 was expected, presently kill'd these little tender creatures, and depriving them of their Animal Motion, left them to be carry'd so slowly to and fro in the Liquor, as to make it visi∣ble that they were then dead and had been before alive.
Notes on the Seventh Title.
VII 1. The Odours of divers Mi∣neral Waters are best judg'd of at the Spring head or other Recepta∣cle, whence some of them being remov'd scarce afford any O∣dour at all (perceptible by us men.)
2. Perhaps the Sulphureous scent, that is sometimes, perceiv'd in Tun∣bridge and some other Waters in their sources, may in part proceed from loose Exhalations, that casually hap∣pen to be mingled with the Waters, but do not constantly belong to it.
3. The winy odour is mention'd among others: Because I am credibly Page  75 inform'd that, in France, there is a Mineral Spring, if not more or less than one, that has such a smell.
4. I mention the Bituminous O∣dour, distinctly from the Sulphureous because men are too apt to confound them, and take all stinking Mineral▪ Waters for Sulphureous, whereas di∣vers are manifestly Bituminous; as may be gather'd, to omit other signs, not only from their proper odours, but from more or fewer drops of Petro∣leum, or a kind of course Naphtha, that are found swimming upon the Water.
5. I think it also not unlikely, that sometimes a Spring may partake both of Sulphur and Bitumen, min∣gl'd together by the Subterraneal Heat, since I have found that I could easily enough melt and incorpo∣rate these two substances here above ground.
Page  76
Notes on Ninth Title.
IX. 1. This is an almost necessa∣ry Article because many Persons, that drink Mineral Waters, cannot well, either for want of strength or conve∣niency, repair immediately to the Spring head, but are oblig'd to drink them in their Beds or their Lodgings, and perhaps to have them transport∣ed to a great distance, or even to ano∣ther country. 2. Many Purging Wa∣ters are found to retain their Laxa∣tive vertue, and that perhaps for a considerable time, thô they be tran∣sported to places distant from those they rise in. 3. In such Ferruginous Waters, as are lighter than common Water, I found a manifest difference in reference to transportation: For most of them, even such as will bear re∣moving, have something of freshness and quickness at the Spring head, (perhaps from some Spirituous and Fugitive Exhalations, that there arise with them, but presently vanish,) that Page  77 they have not any where else. And some do not only lose this briskness by being remov'd, thô in vessels well stop'd, but they lose also the power of producing, with the powder of Galls, a Purple colour, as I found by Tryal purposely made in more than one of these Mineral Waters, which, to prevent fraud, I sent for to the Springs themselves by servants of my own: For thô these carryed their Glass Bottles along with them, and had no other Errand there but to fill and stop them carefully yet, by being transported less than one league, I found them so alter'd, that they would no longer make a Purplish co∣lour with powder'd Galls, but a deep reddish one; whereas the German Spaw Waters did almost alwayes here in London afford me, with the same Powder of Galls, a rich Purple Co∣lour. And Tunbridge Waters afford∣ed me the like, but not so deep a one. when I receiv'd them at Londonvery well stopt. 4. This last clause was not to be omitted, because the exact Page  78 or negligent closing of the vessels, wherein such Waters are transported, is a circumstance of great moment. For more than once I receiv'd at Lon∣don, Waters sent me from Tunbridge by Physicians themselves, (who us'd at least a moderate care in putting them up,) which yet would by no means afford with Galls a purplish Colour. And I found that even the German Spaw-Water would almost presently lose its capacity of being made Pur∣ple by Galls, if it were considerably heated. 5. But the same Spaw-Water being, in Summer time, kept all night in an open Vessel, did the next morning till it was late, if not till Noon, retain a dis∣position to be made Purple by the admixture of Galls; but that dispositi∣on it lost before the next day.
Page  79
Notes on the Fifteenth Title.
XV. 1. Because it often happens, that men have not the leisure and the conveniency totally to evaporate the proposed Mineral Water, it may be an useful thing, to be able without e∣vaporation to discover, whether it contain any common Salt and, if it do, to make some estimate, how copious∣ly or sparingly the Liquor is impreg∣nated with it. This might easily be done, with nicety enough, if I were not by very just Reasons restrain'd, for a while, from communicating that way of examining the saltness and freshness of Waters, of which I did, by the Kings command, show his Ma∣jesty some proofs, whereof mention was presently after made in the print∣ed Gazets. But till it be free for me to impart that way to the publick, I shall only intimate, that some guess may be made at the Saltness of Wa∣ters, by observing, whether they will lather with wash-balls or Soap, Page  80 and, if they will not, what quantity of curdled matter they will produce; as also, whether the Waters will serve for washing of Linnen, and will boil Peas tender? Which two are the most usual wayes that many Sea men take to examine the goodness of unknown Waters by. In divers Purging Wa∣ters this way may be difficult to be practis'd with certainty, because of o∣ther Salts that may be predominant in them; but in the Examen of light∣ly Ferruginous Springs it may be more rely'd upon. 2. It may not be unworthy observation that, when I made use of my own way of exami∣ning the Saltness of Mineral Springs, I did not find even the lightest sort of them devoid of common Salt; which I found, but not in equal pro∣portions, to be contain'd, not only in the several Waters of Islington, Ham∣stead VVater, and, if I misremember not, in some others, but also particu∣larly in TunbridgeVVaters, and those of the German-Spaw, which I did not much wonder at, because I had long Page  81 known, that more or less of common Salt is very usually harbour'd, thô not observed, in many Soils, through which all sorts of Springs, and con∣sequently Mineral ones, have their course.
Notes on the Sixteenth Title.
XVI. Thô Acidity be so usually a manifest Quality of Mineral Waters, that Authors are wont to divide them into Acidulae and Thermae, yet I have found, by several Tryals, that 'tis not near so easy as men presume, to find a manifest Acidity in all Mineral Waters, that are not Sulphureous or Hot. For several Ferruginous Wa∣ters, having probably spent the Aci∣dity they had upon the Iron Ore, which they dissolv'd in their passage, retain so little Acidity, that 'tis hard to discover they have any, either by their working upon Coral, or by any conflict with Spirit of Urine, or the like, or by mixing them with Syrup of Violets, to change the colour of it; Page  82 insomuch that sometimes I should have concluded some such Waters to have no Acidity at all, if I had not had a way of discovering a far less degree of it, than I could discern it to have by other Tryals. The circumstances, that made this way of examining so critical, will cost me too many words to set down here, and I have done it in another Paper expresly written, of the way of discovering the Quali∣ties of divers Bodies, by changes of colour made in or with them: And therefore I shall here but briefly tell you, that I discover the Acidity of Liquors by their operation upon the colours of an Infusion of Lignum Ne∣phriticum made in Lympid Water, (and order'd after a certain manner.) By this means I found the German Spaw Water to retain a little Acidity, even here at London; but more than one of our own Ferruginous Springs did not, even upon this Tryal, appear to have any. And (which some may think strange) I did not find even some of the Purging Springs, particu∣larly Page  83 that of Acton, to have any discer∣nible Acidity.
Notes on the Twentieth Title.
XX. The Scope of this Inquiry was twofold: The first, to discover whether a change of Texture would notably alter the Qualities of the Li∣quor, when the Hermetical Seal hin∣der'd the Avolation of any Saline, Ferruginous, or Spirituous parts: And the other was, to see whether such an Agitation, by heat, as in the open Air would, as I had found, deprive the Spaw Water of the vertue of making a Purple colour with Galls, would cause any manifest separation of parts in the Liquor, and make any grosser substance to precipitate or subside. But thô we did twice (not without difficulty) make the experiment with Spaw Water, yet we made it without success. For the first time the Glass broke at the bottom, before the Wa∣ter we immers'd it in was near boyling hot. And thô the other Glass resist∣ed Page  84 longer, and indur'd a greater heat, yet in not very many Minutes that also broke at the bottom. Which disap∣pointments a faithful Historian ought as little to conceal, as better successes. And I chuse to leave this 20th Arti∣cle of Inquiry in its place, among the rest of the Titles, because possibly some other may be more happy, than I was, in endeavouring to answer it. And I hold it not amiss, in drawing up Platforms of Natural History, to set down what Questions we think fit to be propos'd to nature; because we cannot be sure, before Endea∣vours for Tryal be us'd, whether the thing to be attempted be practically performable or not.
Page  85
Notes on the Twenty sixth Title.
XXVI. 1. Divers wayes may be propounded to discover which of the Qualities, mention'd in this Arti∣cle, is predominant in the Salt to be examin'd; but I confess I somewhat doubt, whether these waies of Tryal be so certain, as many will be forward to think them. 2. If Acidity be guess'd to be predominant in the Salt propos'd it will probably appear by such waies as these. By the Tast, odour, or both: By working upon Coral or Crabs eyes finely powder'd: By curdling of Milk; By making Syrup of violets reddish: By the power of destroying the blew colour of the Infusion of Lignum Nephriticum: By not being Precipita∣ble by Potent Acid Liquors as Oyl of Vitriol, Spirit of Salt; and by being Precipitable by Oyl of Tartar per de∣liquium, as also by strong Spirit of Urine, and other volatile Alcaly's, as they are call'd. But, as I was noting above, I doubt whether these proofs be Page  86 absolutely certain; for, if I mistake not, I found some Purging Mineral Waters that would not give even so slight a proof of acidity, as to destroy the blewness of the NephriticTin∣cture: Which yet would curdle Milk, and turn it to a kind of Posset; and, on the contrary, I found that some Ger∣man Spaw Water would not curdle Milk, & yet would readily deprive the newly mention'd Tincture of its ce∣ruleous colour; which yet I did not find that some of our English Fer∣ruginous Waters were, at least when brought me to London,able to do. 3. The predominancy of an Alcaly, in the Salt of a Mineral Water, may be probably discover'd by such waies as these. By the Lixiviate Tast, Smell, or both; the former of which may be observ'd in the true Niter of the Ancients, (which I have had brought me from Aegypt, and a neighbouring Country, whose name I do not now remember:) By the turning of Sy∣rup of violets green: By the Precipi∣tation Page  87 of solution of sublimate made in Spring-Water: By an effervescence or conflict with some potent Acid, as Aqua fortis, or well dephlegm'd Sp∣rit of Salt: By heightning the red Tincture of Logwood or Brazil, drawn with common Water, to which, may be added a Nicer way or two that I have elsewhere mention'd. But I propose these waies but as ap∣pearing rational, upon the score of my having successfully try'd them with other Saline Bodies that were Alca∣lisate. For as to those Mineral Wa∣ters, I have had occasion to examine, I do not remember I have yet met with any, wherein an Alcaly was pre∣dominant. 4. But perhaps farther Inquiry will discover to others here in England, what I have not yet met with: And I doubt not but that there are, in divers places of the Earth, Salts of an Alcalisate nature. And I pre∣sume that, if the Egyptians were any thing curious of such things, they would find, among their Springs or Wells, divers Waters impregnated Page  88 with them. For I found by Tryals, purposely made upon Latron, as some knowing men call the true Egyptian Niter, presented me by an inquisitive Ambassador who came out of the East, that the native Salt exhibited di∣vers of the same Phaenomena that other factitious Alcali's do. And some Salt, afforded by the famous Waters of Bourbon in France,being brought me thence, with a desire that I would examine it, I found it to be evidently Alcalisate; insomuch that it would make a conflict with Acids, and pre∣sently turn Syrup of violets green. 5. If we suspect Vitriol to be much predominant in the Saline part of a Mineral Water, we may endeavour to discover it by such wayes as these. By its blackning a Solution of Galls: By its vomitive operation upon the Drinkers, thô this may sometimes be an uncertain way especially because an invisible permixture of Arsenic, or or perhaps Arsenical Fumes, may give the Water they impregnate an Emetic Quality: By putting Alcali's Page  89 to a strong solution of the suppos'd Vitriol, and observing whether it will afford a yellow or yellowish Precipi∣tate, if Salt of Tartar or Spirit of Urine be dropt into it. By taking notice, whether a Sulphureous Spirit, espe∣cially▪ such an one as I formerly told I had made thô not here describ'd, will make a blackish or a very dark colour with it, as I first guess'd, and then found it would do with several vitriolate Liquors, and even with one, to make which we had dissolv'd but one grain of a Natural Vitriolate sub∣stance in above four or five thousand times its weight of Syrup or Water. But in the parts about London I re∣member not that, in any of the Waters I have made Tryals on, I have found Vitriol to be predominant, or to be so much as a manifest Ingredient: Which seem'd to me the more re∣markable, because several parts about this City are not destitute of Marca∣sites, the Parents or Wombs of Vitriol. Since the writing of these Papers, being casually visited by a discerning Page  90 Stranger, who had a particular occa∣sion to take notice of the Residences of many of the Mineral Waters of France, his native Country; he an∣swer'd me that he never met with any that was manifestly Vitriolate; and he seem'd to be of opinion, that no Vi∣triolate Spring had yet been disco∣ver'd, among the many Mineral ones that are known to be in that Country. 7. Since we so rarely meet with either manifestly Acid, or evidently Alcalisate, Salts in our English Mine∣ral Waters, it may deserve a serious Inquiry, what other Salts they may be impregnated with; and especially from what Salts, the Purgative ver∣tue, that is found to belong to many of them, as Epsom, Barnet, Acton, &c. do's proceed? Common Salt indeed, as is already noted, I have found to∣kens of in the German Spaw Water; and in all the English Mineral Waters, I had occasion to try, not one that I remember excepted. But I did not find that common Salt was so copi∣ous in any of them, as to disclose it Page  91 self by Chrystallizing in Cubical grains. And the way, I made use of, to examine the Saltness of the Water without Crystallization, is not equal∣ly certain in all sorts of them. And because I had not store enough of these Liquors, to evaporate them in large quantities, thô I could not discern, in the clear Salts they afforded, either Vitriol, or Salt Peter, or Allom, or even common Salt, by their peculiar and genuine Figures; yet I dare not confidently say, that none of our Eng∣lish Mineral Springs abounds with any of those Salts. But as far as I can guess, by the Tryals that I have hitherto had opportunity to make, I am apt to think that the Salt, that is found in our Purgative Waters, and and in some of them copiously e∣nough, dos not belong to any one known sort of Salts, but is either of a sort, for which as for many other Minerals, we have yet no name: or, which seems more probable, is a Salt of a compounded Nature, made up by the coalitions of some or all of Page  92 the Salts above mention'd, and per∣haps of some other, as yet nameless, Subterraneal Salt that the Spring inssolves in its passage, That two Bodies, which are neither of them Cathartic, may, by a change of Tex∣ture, wrought in one another, com∣pose a third Body, that is briskly purgative, I have shewn in another Paper. Besides having formerly had occasion, in order to the resolution of a certain doubt I had entertain'd, to burn Salt of Tartar with about a double weight of common Sulphur, I thence obtain'd, as I expected, a Neutral Salt, that had peculiar Qua∣lities differing from those of the Bo∣dies imploy'd to make it up: And talking of this Salt with an ingenious Empyrick, he told me it had a Qua∣lity I had not mention'd, and that a very useful one, since in the dose of half a dram, or in some Bodies, being taken in Wine or Broth, it would con∣siderably, and yet gently and without gripings, purge. And without the help of Salt of Tartar have sometimes Page  93 made out of common Sulphur, a Chrystalline Salt of a somewhat Vi∣triolate Tast, the like to which might possibly be made under ground, where there are Subterraneal fires, tho per∣haps not observed nor suspected, since we made this Salt without adding any thing to the Sulphur, on∣ly by the help of Fire and common Water. And I remember that a great Virtuoso, several years ago, brought me, in order to an Examen he desir'd I should make of it, a certain Salt af∣forded by a Spring in or near his land, which I remember was in the West of England, tho I have forgot the name of the County: Which Salt no Body knew what to make of, but I quickly told him, I took it to be of the na∣ture of the Sal mirabile Glauberi, and predicted that in such Tryals it would afford such and such Phaenomena, which accordingly came to pass. And I thought that, if opportunity had not been wanting this Salt would have appear'd Purgative, as some factitious Salts that resemble it in Page  94 transparency, colourlesness, and Fi∣gure have been observ'd to be.
Notes on the Twenty seventh Title.
1. 'Tis surprizing to observe, how great an inequality one may some∣times meet with in the proportion that the same quantity, of two▪ differ∣ing Mineral Waters, bear to the Ca∣put Mortuum they respectively afford: For a pound, for instance, of one may, after evaporation, leave behind it perhaps more drams of dry substance, than a pound of the other will leave behind it grains. But because I have no notes of the considerablest Instan∣ces of this kind, that came to my knowledge, I shall add only by and by the Product of a more recent Tryal. 2. As far as I have hitherto observ'd, those Ferruginous Waters, that are not heavier than common Water, and in most Drinkers prove but diuretick, afford but very little Caput Mortuum, or dry Substance up∣on the total Evaporation of the Li∣quor, Page  95 whereas Mineral Waters, that are purging and manifestly more ponderous in Specie than common Water, leave, upon Evaporation, a con∣siderable quantity of residence, thô some far less than others. 3. At once to explain, and partly prove, what I have been saying, I shall here recite that, from a pound of Barnet VVater (which is known to be pur∣gative) slowly evaporated, we ob∣tain'd a Dram of VVhite Powder. But from the like quantity of Tun∣bridge VVater, we obtain'd but about one grain of Caput Mortuum: And, if I misremember not, we had but about a grain and a half from 25. Ounces of the German Spaw Water. 4. It may seem scarce credible to many, that so small a quantity of matter, of which perhaps not one half is Saline, or Metalline, (the rest being teres∣strial,) should impart a manifest ver∣tue to so great a proportion of VVa∣ter. But this difficulty did not much trouble me, who have purposely made divers Experiments, to discover how Page  96 small a proportion of Mineral matter may suffice, when dissolv'd, to im∣pregnate common VVater. I remem∣ber I took one grain of Iron stone, casually found near the Springs at Islington, (from which Mineral 'tis probable those VVaters derive their vertue,) this being open'd by the fire, and dissolv'd as far as it would be in a little Spirit of Salt, we let fall a drop or two of the yellowish solution into a great proportion of Infusion of Galls, to which it presently gave a deeper colour than Tunbridge Water, or even the German SpawVVater, was wont to give here at London, with the Powder of Galls: So that we guess'd that, if we had then had at hand a competent quantity of the in∣fusion, the remaining part of the Martial Solution would have been able to colour ten times a greater quantity of the Infusion, than our Tryal was made upon. This will be easily believ'd by him, that shall consider an Experiment, we afterwards made to the same purpose, Page  97 which was this, VVe dissolv'd a half grain of a good Marcasite, taken up not far from London, in a small quan∣tity of Spirit of Niter, (which for a certain Reason I made choice of, thô other Acid Menstruums, as Aqua∣fortis, and Spirit of Salt would have dissolved the Mineral.) This small solution we put into a pound of pret∣ty high Tincture of Galls, made by infu∣sing them in common Water, and finding, as we expected, that this mixture, grew very dark, we fill'd a Vial with it, and emptying that Vial into a larger Glass, we fill'd the same Vial three times with common Wa∣ter to dilute it; notwithstanding which this new mixture, being put into one of our usual Glasses, appear∣ed of a colour much deeper than that which the Water of Tunbridge, or the German Spaw, had formerly given with the Powder of Galls: So that pro∣bably, if another Vial of common Water had been added, it would yet have afforded a purple colour, if not a dee∣per; so that one part of dissolv'd Mar∣casite Page  98 communicated a Tincture to (61440) sixty one thousand four hundred and forty parts of Infusion of Galls. And that which makes this Experiment more considerable is, that this small quantity of Marca∣site was not it self all Martial or Me∣talline: For from our English Marca∣sites, as well as others, I have ob∣tain'd a pretty quantity of Sulphur like common Sulphur; besides that they afford a not despicable quantity of Terrestrial Substance, about whose nature I have not yet satisfy'd my self. 5. I shall now add this reflexi∣on that, since the Marcasite impreg∣nated so much Water with its corpo∣real Parts, if I may so call them, ob∣tain'd by bare dissolution, it seems highly probable, that the same quan∣tity of Liquor may be impregnated by a far less quantity of Mineral mat∣ter, attenuated into a kind of Spiri∣tuous slate, by being rais'd in the form of Fumes or exhalations; and that imperfect or embryonated Iron may be so, will scarce be deny'd by Page  99 them that consider the way that I have, in another Paper, deliver'd to make Iron manifestly emit copious Fumes, without the help of external Fire. And if it be with some such Spi∣rituous and volatile Exhalations, that a Mineral Water, as that of Tunbridge or of Islington, is impregnated, 'tis not hard to conceive that they may easily lose their chief vertue, by the avolation of most or many of their fugitive Parts, upon their being re∣mov'd to a distance from the Spring head. And to make it probable, that vitriolate Corpuscles may be made to ascend, without losing their na∣ture, I shall here mention an Experi∣ment, that I devis'd to give some light in this matter. I had often found by Tryal, that a Spirit, richly impreg∣nated with volatiliz'd Sulphur, would with vitriol, whether in the form of a powder or a solution, produce in a trice a very dark or blackish colour; And guessing that, in Mercury turn'd by the addition of Salt and Vitriol into corrosive sublimate, many of the Vi∣triolate Page  100 Corpuscles might ascend with the Mercurial ones, I took such a Vo∣latile Sulphureous Tincture as I have been mentioning, (which for this purpose ought to be deep,) and hav∣ing dropt it upon good Sublimate, I found it turn presently of a very o∣pacous colour. To show also that, to make a great dilatation or dispersion of the Martial Corpuscles of an Ore or Mineral, there needs no Spirit of Salt, or the like distill'd Menstruum, I procur'd from a copperas-work, (or place where vitriol is made by art,) some of the Liquor they imploy, be∣fore they cast in Iron, that being cor∣roded by it, it may increase the weight, and give solidity and some other Qualities to the designed Vitri∣ol. Now thó this Liquor be made, without any Chymical Menstruum, barely by Rain or Snow-Water, that impregnates it self with Saline or Me∣talline Particles in its passage through Beds of Marcasites, that lye expos'd to the Sun and Air; yet in this Wa∣ter such numbers of Martial Corpus∣cles Page  101 are dispers'd that, having shaken four drops of it into 12 Ounces and a half of common Water, this Liquor, as I expected, was thereby so im∣pregnated, that with powder of Galls it presently produc'd as deep a colour as good Tunbridge Water would have done. So that, supposing a drop of this Liquor to weigh about a grain, (as by some Tryals purposely made we found it to do,) it appears that one part of the vitriolate Water was able manifestly to impregnate 1500 Parts of common water. And yet of these 4 drops or Grains of Vitriolate Liquor, a considerable part may very probably be concluded, from the way of its production, to have been Rain Water, as will easily be granted when I shall have added, that, to exa∣mine this supposition or conjecture, we slowly evaporated some Ounces of the Vitriolate Liquor, and found that the remaining dry Substance did not fully amount to the 4th part of the weight of the whole. At which rate 'twas easy to conclude, that one Page  102 grain of Vitriolate substance would have been sound capable of so impreg∣nating six thousand times its weight of common Water, as to make it sit to produce with Galls a purple tincture. We afterwards found, upon Tryal pur∣posely and warily made, that the experiment will hold, thô the pro∣portion of the Water, to the grain of tinging substance, should exceed that lately mention'd, by the weight of some hundreds of grains.
TITLES.
For the Natural History of a Mine∣ral water propos'd. Consider'd as a Medicine.
(Being the III. Part of the designed work.)
SECT. VI.
THough the effects of a Mineral Water upon Humane Bodies, as well as upon other Subjects, may Page  103 challenge a place in the Natural His∣tory of it, yet because the Titles of this Third Part of this Scheme, for the most part, directly regard the cure or prevention of diseases, which are held to be the proper Offices of Phy∣sicians as such; I forbore to make any comments upon the particular Titles of this Part of our Historical Idea, contenting my self, for the sake of those that are strangers to Platforms of Natural History, to have set down a series of Titles, which may point out to them what particulars may be fit for their Inquiry, and furnish them with heads whereto they may refer, and Receptacles wherein they may lodge what, upon Tryals or o∣therwise, they shall meet with worthy of observation. And so the accounts, that shall be given on these Subjects, may be somewhat more distinct, and less incompleat.
To what Temperaments and con∣stitutions the Mineral Water propos'd is the most proper, to what less pro∣per, Page  104 and to what noxious or inconve∣nient?
In what stated Diseases, and in what particular cases, the Mineral Water is proper, or to be suspected of being dangerous, if not certainly hurtful?
What difference there is, if any, between the Water taken up and pre∣sently drunk at the Spring it self or o∣ther receptacle, and that which is carryed to some distance off, whe∣ther in open, or in well stop'd Ves∣sels?
Of the manifest Operations of the Water in those that take it, whether it be by vomit, by seige, by Urine, by several, or by two, or all of these waves.
Whether any, occult vertues, or o∣ther hidden Qualities, can be discover∣ed in the Mineral Water? And if any, what?
What variation, in the effects of the Mineral Water, proceeds from its be∣ing drunk all of it quite cold, or hot, or lukewarm, or one part when 'tis in Page  105 one of those tempers, and the rest when in another?
Of promoting or facilitating the operation of the Water, in some by taking it in Bed, and in others by Mo∣derate exercise.
What assistance may be given to the operation of the Water, by giving with it, especially in the first draught, something to make it pass the bet∣ter, or to correct its Crudity, or to strengthen the stomach and Bo∣wels?
What advantages may accrue, from preparing the Patients Body before he enters upon his course of drinking the Waters? And what inconveniences may attend the neg∣lect of such preparation especially in gross, foul, or much obstructed Bodies?
Of the assistance the Water may receive by gently purging Medi∣cines, discreetly given from time to time.
Of the best Dose, or quantity of the Water, to be taken at once; of the com∣pass Page  106 of time wherein it should be all drunk; and of the gradual increasing and lessening the Dose at the begin∣ning, and sometimes before the end, of the whole space of time appointed for the taking it.
How much the greater or lesser length of time, spent in taking the Water, conduces to its good Effects? and what is the fittest measure of time to continue the drinking of it, respect being had to the Patients strength, Disease, the time of the year, the ac∣cidental temperature of the Air, and other considerable circumstan∣ces.
Whether the drinking of the Mineral Water, for several years together, be found almost necessary, or more bene∣ficial than to intermit it sometimes for a year or two, or perhaps lon∣ger, and then to return to the use of it?
Of the Diet, as to meat, drink, ex∣ercise, sleep, &c. That ought to be observ'd by those that take the Wa∣ter, and of the inconveniences that Page  107 are wont to follow the neglect of it.
Of the signes that declare the Water to work kindly and effectually, and of the Tokens of not doing so, and those of its being already hurtful or likely to prove so.
Of the Inconveniences or unwel∣come accidents (if there be any, as usually there is) that have been ob∣serv'd to happen, during, or some time after, the drinking of the Mineral Water, especially to Persons of such constitutions, or that are in such and such circumstances, and of the waies to prevent or remedy such inconvenien∣ces.
Whether there be any necessity, or great use, of taking Physick after one has done drinking the Water? And if there be, what are the fittest times and medicines to be imploy'd for the pre∣vention of any bad effects of it, and what is the danger of neglect to make use of them?
VVhether and how the Mineral VVater may be usefully given by Page  108 being simply commix'd with other Liquors or Bodies, as by boiling meat in it; or by receiving, together with the Additament, a further preparati∣on, as when the VVater is mingled with VVine, or some other Drink; when with Milk 'tis made into Posset drink; when brewed with Mault a∣lone, or with that and hopps, 'tis turn'd into Ale or Beer?
VVhether any such saline, or o∣ther, substance may by evaporation Inspissation, Calcination, &c. be ex∣tracted, or obtained, from the Mineral VVater, as being given in a small Dose, may be substituted, as a Succedaneum to large quantities of the Water as na∣ture affords it?
Of what uses (if of any) the Mi∣neral VVater is, when outwardly ap∣ply'd, as by washing sore Eyes or Ulcers, bathing in it, &c. And whether the mud, or Sediment it leaves, where it passes or stagnates, being externally apply'd, have the same or other Medicinal vertues, and, if so, how the mud is to be ad∣ministred Page  109 to make it exert them.
Of some Mechanico-Medical Trials, that may be made upon Animals, to help us to guess at the Qualities of the Mineral VVaters, as by injecting it into the veins of a Dog, to try whe∣ther it will coagulate his Blood, or make it more fluid, or operate pow∣erfully by Vomit, Siege, or Urine: as also by keeping a Dog very long without allowing him any other Drink at all than the Mineral VVa∣ter.
But I propose such Particulars, as are mention'd in this Article, but as Analogous Experiments, or Succedane∣ums to Tryals that should, but cannot well, because of the worthiness of the Subject, be try'd in living Humane Bodies. And indeed all the Titles of this third part of our design'd History, belong porperly to Physicians; many of whom (at least if they resemble you) are far better qualifi'd, to culti∣vate this Medicinal Subject, than I, who being as little desirous, as fit, to Page  110 incroach upon their Province, shall not inlarge upon this third member of our History, but willingly resign it into their, and especially into your own, more skilful hands.
The Conclusion.
ANd now, Sir, it may be season∣able to put an end, at least for the present, so this Rhapsody of Pa∣pers, by telling you, That theforegoing Idea or Platform of a History of Mi∣neral VVaters, being a draught of, or a First essay upon, so difficult and and uncultivated a Subject, as I have ventur'd to treat of; as I know you are too Iudicious to expect any thing of exactness and compleatness, in what I now present you, so I hope you will be so equitable, or so favourable, a Reader, as to forgive those omissi∣ons and other imperfections, that I cannot doubt, but you, (and even I my self upon a review,) shall discover in the first edition of the foregoing Papers. And thô, if hereafter they Page  111 shall be thought worthy of a Second, I may possibly be able, if God be pleas'd to grant me health and Leisure, to rectify some oversights, and supply some omissions; yet, to deal freely with you, I much fear, that it will be very difficult for far skilfuller Pensthan mine to deliver such Histories of Mi∣neral VVaters, as the curious would wish, and those Criticks, that have ne∣ver made Tryal of the difficulty of attempts of this nature, will be for∣ward to require. And this difficulty will, I presume, be found a great one, not only, (as I have already noted,) by him that shall undertake to give a good account of Mineral VVaters á priori, but to him also that shall take in all the help he can obtain à posterio∣ri. For there are so many circum∣stances, of seasons, VVeather, place, and a multitude of contingencies, that may vary the Phaenomena and effects of Mineral VVaters, that 'tis extream∣ly difficult, either to comprize so ma∣ny different things at once, and as it were survey them at one view, or Page  112 without having such a comprehen∣sion and multitude of various regards, to be able to pronounce with cer∣tainty about the nature, the Medici∣nal Operations, and the other effects, of a Subject that may be influenc'd and diversify'd by so many causes and accidents, as a Mineral VVater may. And therefore, till further dis∣quisitions and Tryals shall have bet∣ter clear'd up the Subject, I shall, without pretending to more, think the past discourse not altogether use∣less, if it can well perform the office of the virgula divinatoria; which, (supposing the truth of what many Chymists and Metallists deliver,) of how little value soever it be of it self, is fit to point at Mineral treasures, and show men the places where they are to seek for them. Farewel.

This belongeth to the 16th Title of the first Part.
'TIs known, that the drinking of Fer∣ruginous Waters, such as those of the German-Spaw and our Tunbridge, is usually prescrib'd for many Weeks, dur∣ing which time it often enough happens, that the Fall of Rains makes men doubt whether the Mineral Water be not so much diluted, as to be spoil'd in its Me∣dicinal Capacity. And indeed I have more than once observ'd, that some such Martial Waters, after considerable Rains lost their Power of producing the wont∣ed Colour with Galls. And therefore it may in some cases be of good use, to be assisted to Conjecture, whether or no the Rain have made the Mineral Water un∣fit for Drinking. In order to this I shall take notice, that usually a small Rain does little or no harm to the Medicinal Spring. And sometimes even a moderate Rain, especially after a long Drought, may, instead of weakning it, increase its vertue, by washing down into its Chan∣nel some Salts, that during the dry wea∣ther, were concreted in the Pores of the Ground, and perhaps also by heightning the Water in the Channel, so as to dis∣solve Page  [unnumbered] some Salts concreted there, which it could not reach before. But if the Rain have long continu'd, the Estimate may best be made, partly by the greater or lesser depth of the Spring beneath the surface of the Ground, and partly and indeed chiefly, by the peculiar nature or strength of the Mineral Water. For some Springs are much more copiously impregnated than others, and there∣fore will bear a greater dilution by Rain-Water, of which I shall give you this notable Instance. That, whereas I found (as I lately noted) that more than one of our English Martial Springs, espe∣cially those near London, were too much weakned by the Water that Rained into them; I had the Curiosity to try, how much of that kind of Liquor, some Ger∣man-Spaw-Water, that came to me to London very well conditioned, would bear. In pursuit of which design I warily made some Tryals, which showed, (what probably will be thought strange, that when the Mineral Water was diluted with no less than thrice its Weight of Rain-Water, it yet retained strength e∣nough to produce with newly powdered Galls, a Purplish colour.
